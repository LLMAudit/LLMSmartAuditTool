","The provided contract `SecretSanta` implements a simple logic for sending and claiming tokens, and it uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` to manage ownership functionalities. Below is the audit of the contract, focusing on security vulnerabilities, logic issues, and best practices.

### General Observations
1. **Invalid Compiler Version**: The contract uses `pragma solidity ^0.5.0`, which is outdated and vulnerable to know security issues. It is recommended to use at least version `^0.8.0`, which includes built-in protections against overflow, underflow, and other common vulnerabilities.

2. **Gas Consumption**: The use of dynamic arrays (`prizeTokens` and `prizeTokensId`) leads to potentially high gas costs on functions where they are iterated, especially when the arrays grow large. Consider optimizing storage or use other data structures to reduce gas costs.

### Function Audits
1. **Constructor**: 
   - No issues noted, but ensure that `initialPrizeDelay` is properly validated to avoid future misbehavior of the contract.

2. **`sendPrize` Function**:
   - **Logic Issues**: The current delay check (`lastPresentAt + prizeDelay > now`) allows sending prizes only if the last present was sent less than the prize delay ago. This may hinder intended repeated interactions.
   - **Reentrancy Risks**: There is a risk of reentrancy in this function, especially due to the external call to `transferFrom`. To mitigate this, you can implement a checks-effects-interactions pattern.
   ```solidity
   // Example of checks-effects-interactions pattern
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
       require(whitelist[tokens[i]], ""Token not whitelisted"");
       // Store state change before calling external function
       prizeTokens.push(tokens[i]);
       prizeTokensId.push(tokensId[i]);
       ERC721(tokens[i]).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokensId[i]);
   }
   ```
   - **Use of `now`**: Consider using `block.timestamp` as `now` is deprecated since Solidity 0.7.0.

3. **`sendPresent` Function**:
   - **Delayed Interaction**: It allows the user to send presents if the delay hasn't passed; however, `lastSecretSanta` is updated just after the transfer. If the transfer fails, the `lastSecretSanta` would have been updated incorrectly. Handle this carefully to maintain consistency.
   - Similar reentrancy concerns exist as in `sendPrize`.

4. **`claimPrize` Function**:
   - **Prize Already Claimed**: Allowing a user to claim the prize after it has already been claimed can be prevented by checking `isPrizeClaimed` at the start of the function.
   - **Loop Risk**: The loop fetching tokens might run into gas limits if too many tokens are sent, so consider using a pattern to allow users to claim tokens in smaller batches or using one by one claims.

5. **`updateWhitelist` Function**:
   - **OnlyOwner**: Proper use of the modifier to restrict access. Ensure that the tokens being added to the whitelist are properly validated to prevent malicious entries.

6. **Getter Functions**: 
   - **Unrestricted Visibility**: The `getPrize` function exposes internal state without restrictions, though it’s not critically vulnerable. Make sure sensitive information is not exposed in some contexts.

7. **`isTooLate` Function**:
   - No vulnerabilities, but ensure that results do not impact external logic, as it can mislead users about their state in this context.

### Conclusion
- **Critical Issues**: Reentrancy attacks in functions that call external contracts and handling of time-based logic that may not work as intended.
- **Use of deprecated methods**: `now` should be replaced with `block.timestamp`.
- **Gas Optimizations**: Consider gas efficiencies in dynamically growing arrays in public functions.
- **Upgrade Solidity Version**: The use of a more recent Solidity version would address several concerns, including overflow protection and enhanced security practices.

### Recommendations
- Adopt a more recent Solidity version (`^0.8.0` or later).
- Implement proper checks-effects-interactions patterns to prevent reentrancy.
- Validate all inputs strictly to avoid invalid states.
- Consider limiting gas-intensive operations or allowing claims to be made in smaller batches to prevent hitting gas limits.
- Perform extensive testing, preferably in a testnet environment before deploying to mainnet.","Sure! Let's evaluate each function in the `SecretSanta` contract independently for potential vulnerabilities and logic issues.

### 1. **Constructor**
```solidity
constructor(uint256 initialPrizeDelay) public {
    lastSecretSanta = msg.sender;
    lastPresentAt = now;
    prizeDelay = initialPrizeDelay;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the contract state correctly. 
- **Potential Issue**: If `initialPrizeDelay` is set to a very small value (e.g., zero), it could lead to continuous valid calls without any delay. Depending on the use case, validating that `initialPrizeDelay` is greater than zero may be prudent.
- **Recommendation**: Consider enforcing a reasonable upper and lower limit for `initialPrizeDelay`.

### 2. **sendPrize**
```solidity
function sendPrize(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata tokensId) external {
    require(tokens.length == tokensId.length, ""Invalid array"");
    require(lastPresentAt + prizeDelay > now, ""Too late"");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 1) {
        require(whitelist[tokens[i]], ""Token not whitelisted"");

        ERC721 token = ERC721(tokens[i]);
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokensId[i]);

        prizeTokens.push(tokens[i]);
        prizeTokensId.push(tokensId[i]);
    }

    emit PrizeAdded(msg.sender, tokens, tokensId);
}
```
**Review**:
- **Logic Issue**: The delay check (`lastPresentAt + prizeDelay > now`) allows only sending prizes if the last present was sent more than `prizeDelay` ago, which seems counterintuitive for a prize submission.
- **Reentrancy Risk**: Calling `transferFrom` on an external contract can allow reentrancy attacks. If the ERC721 implementation is vulnerable, it could allow malicious contracts to affect the state.
- **Gas Limits**: If an attacker sends a large number of tokens, the function could hit the block gas limit, leading to a failed transaction.
- **Recommendation**: The check for timing can be clarified or adapted based on the actual business logic desired. Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern and consider limiting the number of tokens sent in one transaction.

### 3. **sendPresent**
```solidity
function sendPresent(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId) external {
    require(lastPresentAt + prizeDelay > now, ""Too late"");
    require(whitelist[tokenAddress], ""Token not whitelisted"");

    ERC721 token = ERC721(tokenAddress);
    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, lastSecretSanta, tokenId);

    emit PresentSent(msg.sender, lastSecretSanta, tokenAddress, tokenId);

    lastSecretSanta = msg.sender;
    lastPresentAt = now;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Logic Issue**: Similar to `sendPrize`, the time check may not make sense in the context of the present being sent. It limits user interaction.
- **Reentrancy Risk**: Like `sendPrize`, the `transferFrom` call is a point of potential concern if the ERC721 implementation has flaws.
- **State Update After External Call**: The `lastSecretSanta` is updated after the transfer. If the transfer fails, the state will be inconsistent—lastSecretSanta will incorrectly reflect the last sender.
- **Recommendation**: Reassess timing logic to ensure it aligns with business requirements, handle potential transfer failure appropriately, and use checks-effects-interactions.

### 4. **claimPrize**
```solidity
function claimPrize() external {
    require(now > lastPresentAt + prizeDelay, ""Not yet"");
    require(msg.sender == lastSecretSanta, ""Sender not last Santa"");

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < prizeTokens.length; i += 1) {
        ERC721 token = ERC721(prizeTokens[i]);
        token.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, prizeTokensId[i]);
    }

    isPrizeClaimed = true;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Reentrancy Risk**: The same concerns as with previous calls applying here. Changing state (`isPrizeClaimed`) after calling an external contract is not safe.
- **Loop Limitations**: Depending on the number of tokens, this could hit a gas limit. Users might not be able to claim their prizes if too many tokens are in the array.
- **Redundancy**: There is no check to see if a prize has already been claimed, so a user could attempt to claim again.
- **Recommendation**: Add a check for `isPrizeClaimed` at the beginning of the function. Use checks-effects-interactions pattern, and consider creating a ""batch"" claiming mechanism.

### 5. **updateWhitelist**
```solidity
function updateWhitelist(address[] calldata tokens, bool isApproved) external onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; i += 1) {
        whitelist[tokens[i]] = isApproved;
    }
}
```
**Review**:
- **Controlled Access**: The `onlyOwner` modifier is correctly applied. Only the owner can update the whitelist.
- **No Validation**: There is no check to handle if a token is already whitelisted or invalid addresses being added. A check for the addresses might help.
- **Gas Consumption**: The function might become expensive if the array is long. Consider structuring the logic to prevent too many gas limits.
- **Recommendation**: Optionally validate that the address is a contract to check if it can be a valid token contract.

### 6. **getPrize**
```solidity
function getPrize() external view returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory tokensId) {
    return (prizeTokens, prizeTokensId);
}
```
**Review**:
- **Information Disclosure**: This function does not restrict access and reveals potentially sensitive information about prizes stored on the contract.
- **No Issues**: The function itself does not have security concerns given it is read-only and marked as `view`, but be mindful of intention with the information provided.
- **Recommendation**: Use access control if sensitive or critical information is provided, or otherwise document the decision to expose this data.

### 7. **isTooLate**
```solidity
function isTooLate() external view returns (bool) {
    return now > lastPresentAt + prizeDelay;
}
```
**Review**:
- **Simple Boolean Return**: Straightforward, no security issues, but be cautious about its implications.
- **Date Handling**: The use of `now` should be updated to `block.timestamp`.
- **Recommendation**: Update the timestamp usage.

### Overall Summary
- The contract contains several potential reentrancy risks due to external calls, especially in functions that mutate state after such calls. Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern where possible.
- Time-based conditions may need a thorough review to ensure they align with the intended logic.
- Use more recent versions of Solidity for the built-in features and improvements in security and performance.
- Consider gas optimizations in array processing, and address possible limitations in user interactions due to gas requirements or array sizes.
- Add more detailed validations where applicable to ensure robust behavior and avoid unintended states."
