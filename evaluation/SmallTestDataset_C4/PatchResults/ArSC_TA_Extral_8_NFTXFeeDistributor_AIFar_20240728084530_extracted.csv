VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation in `distribute` Function
'''
The `distribute` function does not validate the `vaultId` input. If an invalid `vaultId` is provided, it could lead to unexpected behavior, such as accessing uninitialized mappings or causing division by zero in the calculation of `_allocTotal`. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the `_vault` address retrieved from `INFTXVaultFactory` is a valid contract address before proceeding with the distribution logic.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Add a validation check to ensure that `vaultId` corresponds to a valid vault in the `INFTXVaultFactory` contract.
2. Ensure that the `_vault` address is a valid contract address before proceeding with any operations that involve it.
'''

VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation in `addReceiver` Function
'''
The `addReceiver` function does not validate the `_receiver` address input. If a zero address is provided, it could lead to funds being sent to an invalid address, resulting in a loss of funds. Additionally, the `_allocPoint` value is not checked to ensure it is greater than zero, which could lead to incorrect allocation logic.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Add a check to ensure that `_receiver` is not a zero address.
2. Validate that `_allocPoint` is greater than zero before adding the receiver.
'''

VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation in `changeReceiverAlloc` Function
'''
The `changeReceiverAlloc` function does not validate the `_receiverIdx` input. If an invalid index is provided, it could lead to out-of-bounds access of the `feeReceivers` array, potentially causing a revert or unexpected behavior.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Add a check to ensure that `_receiverIdx` is within the bounds of the `feeReceivers` array length for the specified `_vaultId`.
'''

VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation in `removeReceiver` Function
'''
The `removeReceiver` function also does not validate the `_receiverIdx` input adequately. While there is a check for out-of-bounds access, it does not ensure that the receiver being removed is valid and that the `feeReceivers` array is not empty.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Ensure that the `feeReceivers` array for the specified `_vaultId` is not empty before accessing it.
2. Add a check to ensure that the `_receiverIdx` is valid and corresponds to an existing receiver.

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."". Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics. If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: "" DoS Vulnerability Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, along with recommended mitigation measures or fixes that do not require code upgrades. ''' If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "" No DoS Vulnerabilities."" |

To complete the task,  you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."".
Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: """,
