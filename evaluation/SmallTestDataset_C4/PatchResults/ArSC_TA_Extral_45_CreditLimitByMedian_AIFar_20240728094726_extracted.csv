LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN getCreditLimit FUNCTION
'''
The function getCreditLimit(uint256[] memory vouchs) does not validate the contents of the input array vouchs. It assumes that all elements in the array are valid and non-negative. If the array contains negative values or values that are not integers, it could lead to unexpected behavior when calculating the median. Additionally, if the array is empty, it will return 0, which may not be the intended behavior if the function is expected to handle such cases differently.

Recommended Mitigation:
1. Validate that the input array is not empty before proceeding with the median calculation.
2. Ensure that all elements in the array are non-negative integers.

Example of validation:
```solidity
require(vouchs.length > 0, ""Input array cannot be empty"");
for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchs.length; i++) {
    require(vouchs[i] >= 0, ""Input values must be non-negative"");
}
```
'''

LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN getLockedAmount FUNCTION
'''
The function getLockedAmount does not validate the input parameters, particularly the amount and the LockedInfo array. If the amount is negative or if the LockedInfo array contains invalid data (e.g., zero addresses for stakers), it could lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

Recommended Mitigation:
1. Validate that the amount is non-negative.
2. Ensure that the LockedInfo array contains valid data, particularly checking for zero addresses.

Example of validation:
```solidity
require(amount >= 0, ""Amount must be non-negative"");
for (uint256 i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    require(array[i].staker != address(0), ""Staker address cannot be zero"");
}
```
'''

LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN setEffectNumber FUNCTION
'''
The function setEffectNumber(uint256 number) does not validate the input number. If a negative number is passed (which is not possible in uint256 but could be a concern if the type changes), or if the number is set to a value that is not appropriate for the business logic (e.g., zero or excessively high), it could lead to unintended consequences in the contract's behavior.

Recommended Mitigation:
1. Validate that the number is greater than zero and within a reasonable range based on the business logic.

Example of validation:
```solidity
require(number > 0, ""Effective number must be greater than zero"");
```

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."". Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics. If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: "" DoS Vulnerability Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, along with recommended mitigation measures or fixes that do not require code upgrades. ''' If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "" No DoS Vulnerabilities."" |

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."".
Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: """,
