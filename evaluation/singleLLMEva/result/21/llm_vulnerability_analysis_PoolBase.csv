Reentrancy Identified

The withdrawProtocolBalance function allows an external call to the _token contract (via _token.safeTransfer) before updating the state variable ps.protocolBalance[_protocol]. This can allow a malicious contract to re-enter the function before the state has been updated and manipulate the contract's state or balances again.

The contract depends on block timestamps (specifically block numbers) to enforce critical time-based conditions, which can lead to potential manipulation by miners. Functions such as `cancelCooldown` and `unstake` utilize `block.number` for logic that governs withdrawal and cooldown periods.

POTENTIAL DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DoS) VULNERABILITY
'''
The function `getInitialUnstakeEntry` contains a for loop that iterates over the `unstakeEntries` array of a given staker. If a malicious actor populates this array with a large number of entries, the iteration can become computationally expensive, leading to potential out-of-gas errors. Additionally, this function can be exploited to consume all of the gas available for a transaction, effectively causing a denial of service.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a maximum limit on the number of entries that can be processed in a single transaction or provide a pagination mechanism for accessing unstake entries. This will reduce the risk of abuse by clearly delineating acceptable usage and preventing excessive resource consumption.
'''
```
```
POTENTIAL DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DoS) VULNERABILITY
'''
The `activateCooldown` function also allows for the addition of unstake entries via `ps.unstakeEntries[msg.sender].push(...)`. If an attacker can repeatedly call this function, they can create numerous unstake entries leveraging the gas limit of a transaction. This could make it difficult for regular users to execute their operations due to network congestion or out-of-gas errors if multiple users interact with the contract concurrently.

To avoid this, it can be beneficial to enforce limits on how many entries a single user can create within a defined period or implement a circuit-breaker mechanism that pauses the creation of new entries under heavy load conditions.
'''
```
```
POTENTIAL DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DoS) VULNERABILITY
'''
The `cleanProtocol` function accesses and modifies the `protocols` array. If the array grows excessively due to continuous protocol additions without proper restrictions on how many protocols can be added over a time period, the iteration for cleaning up can consume significant gas, leading to potential failures under heavy load.

It's advisable to implement restrictions on the number of protocols allowed in the array or enable batch-processing to clean up protocols more efficiently and in smaller portions, which would reduce the chance of hitting gas limitations during execution.

VULNERABILITY: Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier on State Changing Functions
'''
The contract allows certain state-changing functions to be invoked without an access control modifier such as 'onlyOwner'. Specifically, functions like `setCooldownFee`, `cleanProtocol`, and any function that modifies critical contract state or balances can potentially be exploited by unauthorized users. This can result in unauthorized changes to contract parameters, handling of funds, and manipulation of key behaviors expected from a trusted party.
 
**Recommended Mitigation:**
Implement the 'onlyOwner' modifier (or require that the caller is an authorized address) on the state-changing functions to ensure that only the contract owner (or designated authorized parties) can execute them. This would help prevent unauthorized access and potential exploitation.

PRECISION LOSS
'''
In the function `getSherXPerBlock(uint256 _lock, IERC20 _token)`, there is an operation that involves integer division:
```solidity
return getTotalSherXPerBlock(_token).mul(_lock).div(baseData().lockToken.totalSupply().add(_lock));
```
If `baseData().lockToken.totalSupply()` is small or the value of `_lock` is significantly larger, this could lead to truncation. The result could be significantly less than what would be expected, especially if the `_lock` is not carefully chosen in relation to the total supply. 
To mitigate this, consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries or ensuring that all variables participating in the division are multiplied by a sufficiently large number prior to performing the division in order to maintain precision.
'''
```
```
PRECISION LOSS
'''
In the `activateCooldown` function, the line:
```solidity
uint256 tokenAmount = fee.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps)).div(ps.lockToken.totalSupply());
```
can lose precision due to integer division. If `ps.lockToken.totalSupply()` is considerably larger than `fee.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps))`, the result will be truncated to zero, leading to incorrect calculations of the tokens allocated to `firstMoneyOut`. To address this, consider rearranging the terms to first compute the numerator with a higher base, or implementing fixed-point arithmetic to preserve fractional values during calculations.
'''
```
```
PRECISION LOSS
'''
In the `getSherXPerBlock(address _user, IERC20 _token)` method, there is another potential for precision loss in:
```solidity
return getTotalSherXPerBlock(_token).mul(ps.lockToken.balanceOf(_user)).div(ps.lockToken.totalSupply());
```
If `ps.lockToken.totalSupply()` is significantly larger than `ps.lockToken.balanceOf(_user)`, this can also lead to a return result of zero or near-zero values due to truncation. As a recommendation, ensure numerator calculations are inflated or consider utilizing a fixed-point math solution to handle divisions involving potentially large integers that could lead to precision loss.
'''
```
```
PRECISION LOSS
'''
In `unstake` function, the amount returned is calculated as:
```solidity
amount = withdraw.lock.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps)).div(ps.lockToken.totalSupply());
```
Similar to previous points, if `ps.lockToken.totalSupply()` is greater than the product of `withdraw.lock.mul(LibPool.stakeBalance(ps))`, it can cause the result to truncate to zero, which is obviously erroneous. The function may be refactored to uphold better precision management by using safe multiplication before division to avoid losses.

REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK
'''
In the function `getInitialUnstakeEntry` there are two conditional checks that may lead to redundant operations:
1. The first check `if (ps.unstakeEntries[_staker][i].blockInitiated == 0) { continue; }` checks if the `blockInitiated` is 0 and continues the iteration. However, this check could lead to unnecessary iterations through all the entries, as entries with `blockInitiated == 0` should effectively be ignored.
2. The second check `if ( ps.unstakeEntries[_staker][i].blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown + gs.unstakeWindow <= uint40(block.number)) { continue; }` can also result in redundant checks since it may already fall within the logic of the first if statement.

A more efficient approach would be to consolidate these checks into a single logical flow or re-evaluate the need of looping through `unstakeEntries` when certain conditions could filter the entries beforehand.

Recommended mitigation: Instead of iterating through all entries, consider leveraging mappings or constructing the logic differently to avoid unnecessary checks or operations that inherently would evaluate to the same state in the process.
'''
```
<INFO> Redundant Conditional Check Identified.

REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK
'''
In the function `unstake`, there are conditional checks after getting the `withdraw` entry from `unstakeEntries` for the sender. The checks `require(withdraw.blockInitiated != 0, 'WITHDRAW_NOT_ACTIVE');` and `require(withdraw.blockInitiated + gs.unstakeCooldown < uint40(block.number), 'COOLDOWN_ACTIVE');` are dependent on one another. If the `blockInitiated` is 0, the second check will inherently be valid (since it will evaluate to 0 + gs.unstakeCooldown < current block number).

These conditions should be logically covered or combined to enhance readability, maintainability, and efficiency by preventing redundant gas consumption from evaluating both conditions separately in contexts where the first condition already provides sufficient logic guarantee.

Recommended mitigation: Combine or reorganize the conditions to reflect a dichotomy more effectively, ensuring that only necessary evaluations happen in the sequence.

REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK

In the function `cleanProtocol`, the checks for accrued debt could be optimized. Specifically:
- First, the condition checks `if (accrued == 0) { require(ps.protocolPremium[_protocol] == 0, 'CAN_NOT_DELETE'); } else { require(accrued > ps.protocolBalance[_protocol], 'CAN_NOT_DELETE2'); }`. The dependency of these checks can coincide with the status of the accrued debt. 

If `accrued` is 0, the follow-up check on `ps.protocolPremium[_protocol]` is executed. However, if there’s no accrued debt, it is sufficient to either fall back to checking `if (ps.protocolPremium[_protocol] == 0)` without having to validate if the `accrued>0` at all, as it leads to redundant checks since it’s already reliant on the value being in a state of no accrued debt.

Recommended mitigation: Combine the conditional logic in such a way that these two checks can be streamlined by either continuing after confirming no debt is present throughout or structurally ensuring that the unallocated premium already fails fast at the path of retrieval without unnecessary checks.

VULNERABILITY: Single External Oracle Dependency
'''
The contract relies on a single external source for data (specifically related to protocol information and balances). This dependence poses risks because if the oracle is compromised or provides inaccurate data, the contract's functionality could be severely affected. A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate outcomes based on faulty information from the oracle.

Recommended mitigation includes integrating multiple oracles to cross-verify data before processing it within the smart contract. This way, even if one oracle fails or is compromised, the system can still rely on the remaining oracles to ensure correct and trustworthy operations.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Fallback Mechanism
'''
The contract currently does not have a fallback mechanism for oracle calls. If an oracle fails to respond or if there is an error in retrieving the necessary data, the contract will fail to execute dependent functions, causing potential denial of service.

To mitigate this issue, implement fallback mechanisms that allow the contract to either reattempt the oracle call or default to a pre-established safe value when an oracle call fails. Additionally, consider using a timeout mechanism to handle prolonged latency issues from the oracle.

The code relies on exact balances in multiple places where the equality comparison may lead to vulnerabilities. For example, in functions like `withdrawProtocolBalance`, it utilizes an exact match when checking if the withdrawal amount is `uint256(-1)` to transfer the entire protocol balance.

This could be exploited by users manipulating the contract, sending exact amounts, or triggering unexpected behaviors during transactions.

Mitigation:
- Instead of relying on exact matches (e.g., `if (_amount == uint256(-1))`), use a conditional check that allows for some flexibility, such as using a threshold amount or allowing for an acceptable range of values.
- Implement checks with tolerance levels instead of exact comparisons, ensuring contract logic continues to work correctly within a reasonable margin of error rather than breaking on precise conditions.

INCONSISTENT BASE TOKENS
'''
The contract does not explicitly verify that the base token used in both the old and new strategies is the same during migration. This could lead to scenarios where the new strategy does not recognize the tokens received during a migration due to differences in the base tokens, effectively causing those tokens to become inaccessible or lost. To mitigate this risk, the contract should include checks to ensure that any token being transferred or acknowledged during strategy migrations is consistent with the expected base token of the strategy being migrated to. This can be accomplished by adding a modifier or a require statement that asserts that the token being handled is indeed the expected base token associated with the strategy.

There are two cases where the code may have Handling Partial Withdrawals vulnerabilities:
1. The contract assumes that the old strategy will have sufficient funds to fulfill the `withdraw` call for the full amount during migration. If the old strategy does not have enough funds, tokens could be left behind, leading to potential loss of funds or incomplete migration.
2. The contract should handle scenarios where only a partial amount can be withdrawn from the old strategy to ensure all funds are migrated properly.

VULNERABILITY: Handling Partial Withdrawals during Migration
'''
The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure that when migrating from an old strategy, it can handle scenarios where the old strategy does not have sufficient funds to fulfill a full withdrawal request. If the old strategy has insufficient funds, it may result in incomplete migrations, leaving tokens behind in the old strategy, leading to potential loss of funds.

To mitigate this, the contract should implement checks to confirm that a full withdrawal can be processed before executing a withdrawal from the old strategy. If there are insufficient funds, the contract should either log the remaining funds or handle the withdrawal of a partial amount appropriately to ensure all funds are migrated without leaving anything behind.

Additionally, the contract should handle cases where only a partial amount can be withdrawn and implement a system to track any unwithdrawn amounts to avoid possible discrepancies or fund losses.

PoolBase.sol,FallbackFunctionDetector,"Your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to the absence of a Fallback Function. There are two primary cases where the code may have Fallback Function vulnerabilities:
1. Contracts that do not define a fallback function, which could lead to accidental loss of ether sent to the contract, as the contract will reject ether transfers if there is no payable fallback function.
2. Contracts that require handling unexpected ether transfers, but lack a mechanism to do so, potentially causing ether to be locked in the contract or the transaction to revert.

NO Fallback Function
'''
The contract does not implement a fallback function, which means it will not accept incoming ether transfers. Any ether sent to the contract will be rejected, leading to potential loss of funds if mistakenly sent by users. It is crucial to implement a fallback function to either handle these ether transfers appropriately or at the very least ensure that such transfers do not result in loss.

To mitigate this issue, declare a payable fallback function in the contract. This function could simply allow receiving ether, for example:
```solidity
fallback() external payable {
    // You can log the received funds or handle them as necessary
}
```
This will allow the contract to accept ether without any loss, ensuring better usability and proper fund handling.

PoolBase.sol,UnlimitedTokenDetector,"Your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Unlimited Token Approval. This vulnerability occurs when a contract approves an unlimited or unnecessarily large amount of tokens for another address to spend. There are two primary cases where the code may have Unlimited Token Approval vulnerabilities:
1. Calls to approve() or increaseAllowance() methods with very large values (e.g., type(uint256).max, 2^256 - 1, or -1).
2. Approval of token amounts significantly larger than what's immediately necessary for a transaction.

DO_LOOP VULNERABILITY
'''
The function `getInitialUnstakeEntry` contains a loop that iterates over `ps.unstakeEntries[_staker]`, which is an array whose length can grow unbounded based on the number of entries. If an attacker exploits this by creating a large number of entries, the loop could consume excessive gas, leading to potential gas exhaustion and a Denial of Service condition for calls to this method. 

**Mitigation Measures:**
1. Implement a maximum limit on the number of unstake entries allowed per staker, enforcing it in the function that adds entries.
2. Consider using a mapping with unique identifiers instead of an array for unbounded data, allowing you to circumvent the need for iterations.
3. Introduce an indexed retrieval system that can quickly ascertain the necessary unstake entry without needing to iterate through the entire list.
'''
```

```
EXTERNAL_CALL_VULNERABILITY
'''
The `withdrawProtocolBalance` function makes an external call to transfer tokens with `_token.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount)`. If the `_receiver` is a contract that runs out of gas or has a failing logic (like a fallback function that consumes excessive gas or reverts), it could lead to the function failing. This failure could disrupt state changes made in the function, leading to a DoS condition if it inadvertently blocks further operations that depend on successful execution.

**Mitigation Measures:**
1. Use `call` instead of `safeTransfer` to handle token transfers, which allows for better control over gas usage and handling errors without reverting the entire transaction.
2. Implement checks before external calls to see if the target address is a contract and only proceed if necessary.
3. Ensure there is a fallback mechanism to handle failures from external transfers.
'''
```

```
STATE_MANIPULATION_VULNERABILITY
'''
In the `cancelCooldown` and `unstakeWindowExpiry` functions, there are conditions that depend on the unstake entries being manipulated by an attacker. If `_account` has many entries, it can affect the execution path and lead to DoS attacks by intentionally keeping invalid entries longer than necessary, potentially leading to blocked states for other users.

**Mitigation Measures:**
1. Implement a maximum cutoff or limit on entries that can be held by an address to avoid extensive chaining of validities.
2. Regularly clean up unused or expired entries in a batched manner, possibly in a scheduled update function that can be called periodically.
'''
```

```
HEAVY_GAS_CONSUMPTION_VULNERABILITY
'''
Certain functions are susceptible to heavy gas consumption due to operations on unstake entries that can grow unbounded, particularly if large arrays are formed. An attacker could send high-gas transactions, making it difficult for others' transactions to be included as their transactions would consume a significant portion of the block gas limit.

**Mitigation Measures:**
1. Enforce limits on the maximum size of operations which can be executed in a single transaction involving loops or large data structures.
2. Introduce gas refunds or mechanisms to drop certain transactions based on gas consumption metrics to ensure smoother functionality.
3. Use efficient data structures and algorithms that minimize the need for looping through large datasets wherever possible.
