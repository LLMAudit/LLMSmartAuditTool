Lack of gas limit considerations
'''
The `submitBatch` function in the contract iterates over the `_amounts` array and performs a token transfer for each destination. If this array is large, it may lead to gas consumption exceeding the block gas limit, resulting in a failed transaction. There are no checks in place to limit the number of iterations based on the gas available, which could lead to out-of-gas errors if a large array is passed. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a limit on the number of addresses processed in a single transaction or break the batch processing into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, you might:

1. Introduce a maximum limit on `_amounts.length` that can be processed in one `submitBatch` call.
2. Provide a way to split large batches into multiple transactions.

This way, you will ensure that the gas limit is respected and the function can execute successfully without hitting the gas limit.

CENTRALIZED PRICE CONTROL
'''
The contract allows the owner (a centralized authority) to control the token transfer without any checks on the prices or ensuring fair pricing mechanisms. This could lead to the owner manipulating token prices by transferring tokens to selected addresses or influencing market conditions unfairly. It lacks decentralization and transparency regarding how tokens are priced, which could potentially allow for exploitation by the owner. 
Recommended mitigation includes implementing a decentralized pricing mechanism, such as integrating with a price oracle or using a decentralized exchange's pricing. Additionally, consider using a multi-signature approach and time delays for significant actions to create checks and balances on the owner’s control.

Centralization Risk - Owner Only Function
'''
The `submitBatch` function can only be executed by the owner of the contract due to the `onlyOwner` modifier inherited from the Ownable contract. This creates a central point of control that, if compromised, could allow the owner to arbitrarily distribute tokens to any addresses without any checks or balances. This risk could be mitigated by implementing a multi-signature ownership or governance mechanism where multiple parties must agree to execute critical functions like token distribution. Alternatively, you could allow designated users or an elected committee to perform actions, thereby reducing reliance on a single point of control.

The contract does not define a fallback function to handle ether transfers. This can lead to a scenario where any ether sent to the contract is rejected, causing the sender to lose their ether. Since the contract does not have a payable fallback function, it cannot accept ether, and any attempts to send ether to it will fail.

Recommended mitigation/fix:
To address this issue specifically, you can include a payable fallback function that allows the contract to accept ether. This way, if ether is sent to the contract by accident, it will not be lost. The fallback function can be a simple implementation like this:

```
receive() external payable {}
```

Including this will also allow the contract to accept transfers of ether without affecting the existing functionality of the contract.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Input Validation in `submitBatch`
'''
The `submitBatch` function does not validate the inputs for `_amounts`, `_destinations`, or `_tokenContract`. This could lead to several issues:

1. **Zero Address Check**: If a zero address is provided in the `_destinations` array, it would result in tokens being transferred to the zero address, effectively burning them. There is no check to ensure that all addresses in `_destinations` are valid (non-zero).

2. **Mismatch in Array Lengths**: The function does not verify that the lengths of `_amounts` and `_destinations` are the same. An unequal length could lead to out-of-bounds access, potentially causing a revert.

3. **Negative Amounts**: Although Solidity does not allow negative integers for unsigned values, there should be a check (or a clear restriction) to ensure that the amounts are greater than zero to avoid transferring zero tokens inadvertently.

4. **Invalid Token Contract**: There is no validation to ensure that the provided `_tokenContract` implements the IERC20 interface. An attacker could provide a contract address that does not conform to the expected token behavior.

Recommended mitigations include:
- Adding checks to ensure that `_tokenContract` is a valid contract that implements the IERC20 interface.
- Implementing checks to ensure none of the provided addresses in `_destinations` are the zero address.
- Validating that the lengths of `_amounts` and `_destinations` are the same before proceeding with transfers.

LOOP WITH UNBOUNDED ITERATION COUNT
'''
The submitBatch function contains a loop that iterates over the _amounts array. If an attacker provides a very large array (e.g., maximum size allowed by the block gas limit), this could lead to gas exhaustion (out of gas error) when the function is called. This can effectively perform a denial of service by forcing the transaction to fail, making it impossible to execute meaningful transactions until the condition is managed. To mitigate this vulnerability, consider imposing a maximum array length limit (e.g., using a constant) that is feasible to process within the gas limits, or using a batched approach where the transactions can be split across multiple calls.
