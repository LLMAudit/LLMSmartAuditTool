UNCHECKED EXTERNAL CALLS VULNERABILITY
'''
The contract contains a potential vulnerability related to unchecked external calls, particularly in the context of the transfer and transferFrom functions, which interact with other contracts. In the current implementation, the calls to other contracts (e.g., via the ERC20 standard interface) do not check the success of these calls, which means if the called contract reverts or returns false, the state of the current contract may be inconsistent, leading to loss of funds or other unintended effects.

For instance, while the _transfer function checks balances and requires that sender and recipient cannot be zero, it does not check the success of any called transfer function on a potentially external ERC20 token contract when tokens are being transferred or approved. As per the ERC20 standard, it is expected that `transfer` or `transferFrom` should return a boolean indicating success, but this is not enforced by checking the result.

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to check the return value of external calls:
1. Utilize the `require()` statement to ensure the return value is true when calling `transfer`, `transferFrom`, or any other external contract call that follows the ERC20 standard.
2. Example modification: 
   ```solidity
   require(IERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(recipient, amount), ""Transfer failed"");
   ```

This way, if the external call fails, the transaction will revert, preventing any state change or loss of funds.

ERC20.sol,OracleDependencyDetector,"Your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to External Oracle Dependency. There are two main concerns related to External Oracle Dependency vulnerabilities:
1. Dependence on a single external oracle for critical data, which pertains to the reliability of the data source. If the oracle is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the contract's functionalities could be adversely affected.
2. Lack of fallback mechanisms, which can lead to the contract failing if the external oracle call fails or returns invalid data. This could be exploited by adversaries to disrupt the contract's operations.

Lack of Authorization
'''
The provided contract does not include any functionality to change the ownership of the contract or the tokens. However, should there be a function such as `changeOwner` added in the future, it is critical to ensure it has proper access control. Without any checks, this function would allow anyone to change the owner of the contract to their address, thereby enabling unauthorized control.

To mitigate this, use a modifier such as `onlyOwner` that restricts access to the function. Implement the Ownable contract pattern from OpenZeppelin or create a custom owner management logic to prevent unauthorized ownership changes.

Centralization Risk Due to Single Address Control
'''
The contract contains private functions such as `_mint` and `_burn` which can only be executed by the contract itself, allowing total control over the token supply if the private parts of the contract are not extended or overridden. This effectively centralizes the control of token issuance and destruction to the address of the contract itself. If an admin account or privileged user has complete control over the contract's deployment and instance management, any compromise of this address could lead to serious vulnerabilities, such as unregulated minting or burning of tokens. 

Recommended mitigation:
- Implement a multi-signature wallet for critical operations like minting and burning. This way, no single address can manipulate the total supply without the consensus of multiple parties.
- Alternatively, consider allowing a designated governance mechanism that allows token holders to vote on critical changes or functions like minting and burning, thus spreading the control and reducing centralization risks.

VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation on User Inputs
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not properly validate user inputs in several key functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burn`. For instance, while it checks for zero address for parties involved in the transaction, it does not validate that the `amount` being transferred or approved is greater than zero, allowing an attacker to execute operations with a zero or negative value (if such scenarios were possible, e.g., in a modified version). Adding such checks would prevent unexpected behavior from non-positive values being processed.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION/FIX: Always validate that amounts are greater than zero within methods that involve transfers or approvals. This would be done with a check like `require(amount > 0, ""ERC20: Amount must be greater than zero."");` as the first line of the relevant method.
