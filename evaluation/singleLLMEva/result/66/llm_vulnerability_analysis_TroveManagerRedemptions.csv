/** 
 * TroveM...","Upon reviewing the `TroveManagerRedemptions` contract code, there are concerns regarding potential reentrancy vulnerabilities that may arise from external calls being made before state updates. Below are the findings:

```
REENTRANCY IDENTIFIED
'''
In the `redeemCollateral` function, external calls are made to `contractsCache.yusdToken.safeTransferFrom` and `contractsCache.activePool.sendCollateralsUnwrap` after state-modifying operations such as updating the YUSD debt with `contractsCache.activePool.decreaseYUSDDebt`. Specifically, the function allows for the transfer of YUSD from the redeemer to an external contract (YETI stakers) without first updating the balance or state. An attacker could potentially execute a reentrant call before the state changes are completed, potentially allowing them to manipulate their state in an unexpected manner.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Employ the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by performing all state updates before making external calls, ensuring that no state-sensitive operations are exposed to reentrancy. Alternatively, consider using a ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.

The identified vulnerability stems from the nature of the iteration logic and calls to external contracts that require careful state management; thus it is crucial to apply safeguards to the execution flow to prevent exploitability."

UNCHECKED EXTERNAL CALLS
'''
In the contract’s function, multiple external calls are made without checking their return values. Particularly, the following calls could pose significant risks:
1. `contractsCache.yusdToken.safeTransferFrom(...)` - This call transfers tokens from the redeemer to the sYETI contract but does not verify that the transfer was successful, which could lead to loss of funds if the transfer fails for any reason.
2. `contractsCache.yusdToken.burn(...)` - This function presumably burns tokens but does not give feedback if the burn process was successful. Burning tokens incorrectly could create inconsistencies in the contract's accounting.

To mitigate these risks, the contract should be modified to handle the return values appropriately. It is recommended to use checks for the return values of external calls as follows:
- Wrap the calls in `require(...)` checks to ensure they succeed. For example:
  require(contractsCache.yusdToken.transferFrom(...), ""Transfer failed"");
  require(contractsCache.yusdToken.burn(...), ""Burn failed"");

The contract relies on block timestamps in the `_requireAfterBootstrapPeriod()` function, where it checks if the current block's timestamp is greater than the contract's deployment time plus a defined bootstrap period. This approach can be manipulated by miners, who can influence block timestamps and potentially exploit this to trigger or bypass certain conditions based on timing.

Mitigation:
Instead of relying solely on block timestamps, consider using block numbers for critical conditions. You could implement a fixed number of blocks that represent your desired time (e.g., after a certain number of blocks since deployment), reducing miner influence. Additionally, combining block timestamps with a minimum time condition can provide increased robustness against manipulation.

Lack of gas limit considerations due to potential while loop in redeemCollateral function

The redeemCollateral function includes a while loop that iterates through borrowers until a specific condition is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached. If the condition is such that numerous borrowers are checked until a specified borrower meets the criteria for redemption, it may lead to excessive gas consumption and potentially out-of-gas errors, particularly in circumstances where many troves exist in the contract. This would result in failed transactions and users unable to redeem their collateral as intended.

VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
'''
Potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability

The redeemCollateral function's reliance on external calls within a while loop, combined with the absence of gas limit checks, poses a significant risk of DoS attacks. A malicious actor could exploit this by creating a trove structure which causes the loop to consume excessive gas, ultimately leading to network congestion or making the function temporarily unavailable. No mechanisms or fail-safes are implemented to account for this potential scenario.

Mitigation strategies could include limiting the number of iterations a function can perform based on calculated gas costs or implementing a timeout where the loop would exit if certain conditions are not satisfied after a specified maximum number of iterations. This would allow for the functions to become more robust against such attacks.

**POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY: State Mutability and Data Manipulation**
'''
The contract performs several critical state manipulations, particularly with shared storage and local memory, but lacks proper checks and balances in the following scenarios:

1. **Borrower’s YUSD Balance Check**: The check `require(contractsCache.yusdToken.balanceOf(_redeemer) <= totals.totalYUSDSupplyAtStart, ""TMR: redeemer balance too high"");` in the `redeemCollateral` function assumes that the redeemer's balance won't change between checking and using the balance. This could lead to a state where a user’s balance has changed (potentially through other transactions) before executing the redemption, which could result in an attempt to redeem more than possible.

2. **Single Redemption Logic**: In the `redeemCollateralSingle` function, the contract retrieves collateral and subsequently adjusts the amounts. It modifies `colls.amounts` directly without a copying mechanism. If the state access leads to unintended changes (e.g., another operation modifies this collateral structure), it could yield unexpected values leading to incorrect redemption amounts.

3. **Loop-based Trove processing**: The `_redeemCollateralFromTrove` function iteratively processes troves which depend heavily on state updates. If multiple transactions are processing simultaneously, one transaction may change the state (like ICR or debt) while another is reading and acting upon it, potentially leading to miscalculations and execution errors.

4. **Token Transfers**: The functions also assume that token transfers or updates to collateral can happen without interference from concurrent operations. This is a common risk in Solidity contracts using global states or shared resources that can be accessed by multiple actors.

**RECOMMENDED MITIGATION:**
Introduce a locking mechanism (like reentrancy guards) or utilize checks on state changes just before critical operations. Furthermore, enforce more rigorous checks right before executing actions that depend on variables that other functions or transactions may modify. Employ events to monitor state transitions and utilize them for state consistency validation, especially when performing read and write operations in loops or high-frequency interactions.

INTEGER DIVISION
'''
The contract contains several instances of integer division, particularly in the following scenarios:
1. The `_updateBaseRateFromRedemption` function utilizes the expression `redeemedYUSDFraction = _YUSDDrawn.mul(10e18).div(_totalYUSDSupply);`. Here, if `_totalYUSDSupply` is less than `_YUSDDrawn`, the result will be zero due to integer division truncation. This causes a loss of precision and incorrect results.
2. The use of `baseLot.mul(colls.amounts[i]).div(totalCollUSD).div(1e18);` in the `_redeemCollateralFromTrove` function may also lead to precision loss when calculating the token amount, particularly if `totalCollUSD` is significantly larger than `colls.amounts[i]`, causing the final result to be truncated.

To mitigate this, consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries or introducing a custom function that performs multiplication before division, maintaining higher accuracy.
'''
```
```
LOSS OF PRECISION IN RECTIFYING REDEMPTION FEE
'''
In the `_calcRedemptionFee` function, the redemption fee is calculated as `redemptionFee = _redemptionRate.mul(_YUSDRedeemed).div(DECIMAL_PRECISION);`. If `_redemptionRate` is lower such that the multiplication approaches the limits of uint256 but is not adequately scaled, precision loss may occur. If the resulting multiplication exceeds uint256 limits before division or if the division results in truncation due to integer division mechanics, it can lead to incorrect fee calculations.

Recommended mitigation includes implementing checks to ensure that `_redemptionRate` multiplications are handled properly, or alternatively, using a fixed-point arithmetic approach to maintain precision better.

However, it's already ensured that if `_firstRedemptionHint` is a valid address and if `troveManager.getCurrentICR(nextTrove) < MCR`, then the `_firstRedemptionHint` must also be valid by an earlier placement as it explicitly checks that it is contained in the sorted trove. The check for `_firstRedemptionHint == address(0)` could be removed since it's already being checked against the `_sortedTroves.contains` previously directly in the function.

VULNERABILITY: SINGLE EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY
'''
The contract relies on the TroveManager for critical data such as the current Instant Collateral Ratio (ICR) and redemption rates. If this oracle becomes compromised, returns incorrect data, or is unavailable, the functionality of the contract can be severely impacted. This reliance poses a significant risk, as the outcome of significant operations may be derived from invalid data.

Recommended mitigation strategies could include implementing a multi-oracle pattern where multiple oracles provide the same data, and an aggregation mechanism is used to obtain a consensus value, thereby reducing dependence on a single source.
'''

VULNERABILITY: LACK OF FALLBACK MECHANISM
'''
The internal calls to TroveManager for data retrieval (such as getTroveDebt, getCurrentICR, etc.) do not contain any fallback mechanism in the event that the queries fail or return invalid data, which can lead to contract failure or exploitation.

A recommended fix would involve implementing try-catch patterns (for Solidity versions that support them) or checks after each oracle call to ensure that the returned data is valid or meet certain criteria before proceeding with calculations or state changes.

OWNERSHIP HIJACKING VULNERABILITY
'''
The `changeOwner` function is not present in the provided code, but the comment highlights a critical vulnerability regarding ownership management. If such a function were implemented without proper authorization checks, it would allow any address to change the owner of the contract, leading to unauthorized access and potential control over the contract. This would constitute an Ownership Hijacking vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to delegate control to themselves or another malicious address.

To mitigate this vulnerability, any function intended to change ownership, such as `changeOwner`, must implement access control mechanisms. The `onlyOwner` modifier should be used to restrict the use of ownership change functions to the current owner only. Additionally, events should be emitted on basis of ownership changes for better transparency in ownership governance. If the current code does not implement such a mechanism, it is strongly recommended to add adequate validation to preserve ownership integrity.

require(contractsCache.yusdToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) <= totals.totalYUSDSupplyAtStart, ""TMR:Redeemer YUSD Bal too high"");

Here, the `balanceOf(msg.sender)` is compared to `totalYUSDSupplyAtStart` using '<=' which introduces an unnecessary comparison because if the redeemer has a balance greater than `totalYUSDSupplyAtStart`, the redemption should not proceed. Since checking for balances typically ensures they are within acceptable limits beforehand, this condition could be simplified.

There are specific cases where the code may have Impracticality of Exact Match vulnerabilities:
1. The use of `this.balance` for checking if the funding goal is reached is flawed. This exact comparison is risky because even a tiny amount above or below the target amount will result in a false value. Moreover, users could manipulate the contract by sending an exact amount to influence the outcome.
2. Relying on an exact balance match for contract logic can lead to unexpected failures or exploitations due to the granularity of ether (wei) and typical transaction handling in Ethereum.

Impracticality of Exact Match
'''
The contract relies on exact matches for certain operations related to the YUSD balance in the redeeming process. For example, it checks if the redeemer's balance is equal to a calculated total YUSD supply in some cases. This can lead to issues where transactions could fail due to minor fluctuations in balance. Furthermore, malicious users could attempt to manipulate contract logic by sending an exact amount of YUSD to trigger specific conditions, leading to unexpected functionalities or denial of service.

To mitigate this, the contract should avoid using exact balance checks. Instead, it should utilize range checks or more forgiving logic that allows for minor discrepancies. For instance, using a condition such as `if (balance > requiredAmount)` or `if (balance >= requiredAmount)` would help alleviate some of these issues, thus preventing direct reliance on exact equality checks.

HANDLING PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS
'''
The contract does not adequately handle scenarios where only a partial amount can be withdrawn from the old strategy during migration. Specifically, in the function `_redeemCollateralFromTrove`, there could be cases where the full YUSD requested for redemption is not available, resulting in a partial redemption. If the hint provided for the redemption is outdated or does not align with the actual state of the contract, it may trigger a cancellation of the partial redemption, which means it will leave behind unutilized funds or collateral that the user intended to redeem. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, the contract should implement a more robust mechanism for handling partial redemptions. This could involve:
1. Allowing the redemption process to continue even if a full redemption cannot be completed, by processing whatever amount is available and notifying the user of the funds that remain.
2. Keeping track of any remaining balance after a partial redemption attempt, so that it can be queued for future redemptions.
3. Properly handling the case where the full amount cannot be redeemed and ensuring that users are aware of the maximum amount that has been redeemed versus what was requested.

There are two primary cases where the code may have Fallback Function vulnerabilities:
1. Contracts that do not define a fallback function, which could lead to accidental loss of ether sent to the contract, as the contract will reject ether transfers if there is no payable fallback function.
2. Contracts that require handling unexpected ether transfers, but lack a mechanism to do so, potentially causing ether to be locked in the contract or the transaction to revert.

/** 
 * TroveM...","<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION ON ADDRESS OR ZERO VALUES
'''
The contract fails to perform adequate input validation to ensure that certain critical addresses and values passed to functions are valid. For example, in the `redeemCollateralSingle` function, the _YUSDamount, _YUSDMaxFee, addresses like _firstRedemptionHint, _upperPartialRedemptionHint, and _lowerPartialRedemptionHint do not have direct validation checks to ensure they are not zero addresses or negative values where applicable. This can lead to various vulnerabilities such as enabling an attacker to call functions with invalid addresses, which could lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Validate input addresses like `_firstRedemptionHint`, `_upperPartialRedemptionHint`, `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint`, and `_collToRedeem` to ensure they are not zero addresses (`require(_address != address(0), ""Invalid address"")`).
- Ensure that `_YUSDamount` and `_YUSDMaxFee` are non-zero values upon function entry, which is partially done but the function could be expanded to ensure no negative values exist.
- Implement constraint checks for any amounts to ensure they do not exceed predefined limits.
'''
```

```
LACK OF BOUNDS CHECKS ON USER BALANCES
'''
In the `redeemCollateral` and `redeemCollateralSingle`, the smart contract checks the user's YUSD balance against the total supply of YUSD without a comprehensive verification that the calculated values are within expected thresholds. The current check only ensures that the sender's YUSD balance does not exceed the total YUSD supply at the start, but does not ensure that the balance is within a reasonable limit for transaction execution.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Before executing transactions that involve transfers or balance checks, introduce further logic to ensure the user's balance and operations do not lead to an overflow situation, especially when calculating the values of YUSD that might be redeemed.
- Add checks to ensure that the amount being redeemed or fees being calculated do not exceed the bounds of the YUSD balance held by the user.
'''
```

```
INPUT VALUES CALCULATION WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARD
'''
In the function `_updateBaseRateFromRedemption`, various calculations are performed involving the total YUSD supply and redeemed amounts. While there are checks against preset constants, there are scenarios where a zero value or minimally low amounts could cause issues in the calculations that may lead to erroneous behavior, such as division by zero in the computation of a new base rate when `_totalYUSDSupply` is zero.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Add checks to ensure that `_totalYUSDSupply` is greater than zero before proceeding with the redemption calculations to prevent potential division by zero errors.

<INFO> DoS Vulnerability Identified.
UNBOUNDED ITERATION LOOP
'''
The presence of the `while` loop in the `redeemCollateral` function, which iterates through users in a sorted list of troves, could lead to unbounded iterations. If the number of users is large, the iteration can consume all the gas available for the transaction, potentially leading to gas exhaustion. An attacker could manipulate the system by adding many troves to the sorted list, thereby causing legitimate transactions to fail due to hitting the block gas limit.

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing a limit on the maximum number of iterations that can be performed in the loop or configuring the function to process a set number of users per call, requiring multiple transactions for larger amounts to be redeemed.
'''
```

```
<INFO> DoS Vulnerability Identified.
EXTERNAL CALLS AND STATE DEPENDENCIES
'''
The function `_redeemCollateralFromTrove` contains state-dependent logic where the position of a user in the sorted list is relied upon to determine if they can redeem collateral. If a malicious actor manages to manipulate the hints or the sorted list by keeping their Trove out of the redemption cycle (e.g., by over-adding themselves or tweaking states), they could cause other users attempting to redeem to experience unnecessary failures. The `require` statements involved in checking conditions before calling external functions can also lead to a DoS state if these conditions are exploited.

To mitigate, it would be prudent to ensure an upper limit on how many times a user can appear in the redemptions or design the contract in such a way that circular dependencies do not exist, ensuring that the contract logic can reliably execute without being contingent on external user states.
