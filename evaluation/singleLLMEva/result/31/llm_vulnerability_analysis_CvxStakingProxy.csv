The contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to Integer Overflow and Underflow in the calculation of the `incentiveAmount` and when subtracting it from the total balance. Specifically, when calculating:
- `uint256 incentiveAmount = cvxCrvBal.mul(callIncentive).div(denominator);`
- `cvxCrvBal = cvxCrvBal.sub(incentiveAmount);`

If `callIncentive` is greater than `denominator`, `incentiveAmount` could be greater than `cvxCrvBal`, leading to underflow when performing the subtraction. Although the initial checks on `callIncentive` and `denominator` limit `callIncentive` to a maximum of 100, it’s essential to ensure that no arithmetic operations could cause an overflow or underflow, especially after any adjustments to the `callIncentive`.

Recommended mitigation measures include:
1. Ensure to validate the values of `callIncentive` and `denominator` at all times in the relevant calculations. 
2. Always perform arithmetic operations using `SafeMath` functions to guarantee safety against overflow and underflow conditions.

For example:
```solidity

The contract makes external calls to various contracts, particularly in the `withdraw`, `stake`, and `distribute` functions, which can lead to reentrancy attacks. For example, the `withdraw` function calls `IConvexRewards(cvxStaking).withdraw(_amount, false);` followed by an Ether transfer via `IERC20(cvx).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);`. If the `msg.sender` is a malicious contract, it can call back into the `withdraw` function before the state changes (like updating balances) are completed.

Unchecked External Call in distribute function.

The `distribute` function makes an external call to the `IConvexRewards(cvxStaking).getReward(false);` function without checking the success of this call.

This could provide an opportunity for malicious actors to exploit the contract.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
It's advisable to check the result of external calls, especially when they involve important state changes or financial transactions. Wrap the call in a require statement to ensure it succeeds:

VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
'''
Transactions Order Dependence in `distribute` Function

In the `distribute` function, there's a potential issue with how rewards are distributed, particularly related to the sequencing of transactions. The function retrieves rewards using `IConvexRewards(cvxStaking).getReward(false);` and then processes these rewards for distribution to the `msg.sender`. If transactions are ordered strategically, it could result in a scenario where the funds are distributed before the previous set of actions (like staking the tokens) are fully actionable or finalized. This could allow a malicious actor to re-enter the `distribute` function after the first transaction but before the reward distribution, potentially misappropriating parts of the funds.

Mitigation Measures:
1. Introduce a reentrancy guard pattern that prevents multiple calls to the `distribute` function until its first execution is completed.
2. Use checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes happen before any interactions with external contracts or transfers.
3. Implement a time lock or a similar mechanism to limit rapid successive calls to the `distribute` function, preventing a malicious actor from overriding legitimate transactions by backdooring calls.

Transactions Order Dependence in `withdraw` Function

In the `withdraw` function, funds are transferred back to the caller (`msg.sender`) after unstaking from `IConvexRewards(cvxStaking).withdraw(_amount, false);`. A malicious actor could strategically time their transaction submission to take advantage of the timing between these operations where they can observe and act upon checking the current balance or submitting additional actions based on transaction details, leading to exploitation.

Mitigation Measures:
1. Ensure that you don't expose sensitive state (like balances) before finalization of crucial functions which handle finances.
2. Again, apply checks-effects-interactions, particularly ensuring balance checks and transfers are handled in a way that does not expose intermediate states, which could leak information.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of gas limit considerations in `distribute` function
'''
The `distribute` function makes a call to the `ICrvDepositor.deposit` method with the total `crvBal` amount as an argument. If the balance of `crv` tokens is very large, this can lead to excessive gas consumption. Additionally, the lack of gas limit checks, when performing the external call to `notifyRewardAmount` in the same function, can also lead to out-of-gas errors if the contract or the token contract experiences heavy load or is manipulated to consume more gas than anticipated. 

To mitigate this, it's advisable to implement mechanisms that could check the current gas limit before proceeding with such operations or limit the maximum amounts that can be staked or deposited. An example fix would be to cap the amount that can be deposited based on a pre-defined maximum threshold or adding a mechanism to monitor and limit the iterations or amount processed in the `distribute` function based on the gas available.

POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY IN REWARD DISTRIBUTION
'''
There is a potential data inconsistency issue in the way rewards are distributed and accounted for in the `distribute()` and `distributeOther()` functions. Specifically, after computing the distribution amounts for incentives and the main rewards, the code assumes a straight subtraction from the total balance, which is stored in `cvxCrvBal` or `bal`. 

If `safeTransfer` fails for any reason (like the recipient being a contract that reverts on receiving tokens), then the distribution will not be consistent with what the contract thinks it has allocated. This could lead to a scenario where the contract believes it has successfully distributed the rewards while it actually has not, hence creating a mismatch in rewards distribution.

To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to implement checks after `safeTransfer`. Verify whether the expected balances after transfer correspond to the actual balances to ensure integrity between what the contract computes for rewards and what is actually transferred. Consider implementing a check after each transfer to confirm that the operation was successful, and keep careful track of any increasing balances locally rather than solely relying on balances from the token contract.

The contract calculates incentive amounts using `cvxCrvBal.mul(callIncentive).div(denominator)` and `bal.mul(callIncentive).div(denominator)` where `callIncentive` is a percentage value.

There is no need to check each token against these constant addresses during every transaction as they do not change. Instead, it would be cleaner to revert the action directly in cases where the token matches, potentially optimizing gas costs and simplifying the condition structure.

VULNERABILITY: Reliance on a Single External Oracle
'''
The contract relies heavily on external contract calls, specifically to the `IConvexRewards` and `ICrvDepositor` interfaces for staking and reward mechanisms. If the external contracts (Covex or Curve) become compromised or provide unreliable data (e.g., incorrect rewards), the contract's functionality could be adversely affected. If these oracles malfunction or produce faulty data, users could incur losses or the contract could become inoperable.

Recommended Mitigation:
To mitigate this issue, consider implementing multiple oracle sources to cross-verify data. For critical operations, introduce a failover or backup oracle system that can take over if the primary oracle fails or produces suspicious results. Additionally, add checks or validations on the data returned from the oracles to ensure its reliability before executing sensitive contract functions.
'''

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Fallback Mechanisms
'''
The contract does not include any fallback mechanisms for handling failed calls to external oracles. For example, if a call to `IConvexRewards.getReward()` fails or returns invalid data, there isn’t a recovery or fallback procedure in place. This could lead to situations where the contract cannot execute important functionalities due to the unavailability of the external oracle.

Recommended Mitigation:
Introduce error handling and fallback mechanisms for external calls. This includes implementing try-catch patterns (if using Solidity >=0.8.x) to gracefully handle errors in external calls or adding logic to revert actions if external data fails checks. Additionally, consider including timeouts or alternative flow paths that allow the contract to continue functioning even if the oracle data is inaccessible or invalid.

Impracticality of Exact Match
'''
In the contract, the logic for distributing rewards and handling token balances relies on precise values that may lead to vulnerabilities. For instance, the contract uses `IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))` and conducts transactions based on exact balances. This introduces risks because:

1. If users or transactions slightly miss the intended value by just a small fraction (down to the wei level), it could disrupt crucial logic such as reward distribution or staking.
2. Transactions can alter the exact balance at the time of operation due to gas consumption and the order of transaction execution, leading to potential changes in expected behavior.

**Recommended mitigation/fix:**
Instead of relying on exact matches or exact values, utilize thresholds or ranges when performing balance checks or comparisons. For instance, consider allowing for a certain percentage of tolerance around the expected value. Also, implement checks to ensure that any calculations handle minimum thresholds effectively rather than exact figures.

INCONSISTENT BASE TOKENS VULNERABILITY
'''
The contract does not verify that the strategies using the same base token during migrations. Specifically, there is no mechanism to confirm that the old strategy and the new strategy share the same token upon migration. If a new strategy is introduced that utilizes a different base token, the contract could fail to recognize transferred tokens, leading to the potential loss or inaccessibility of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a verification step within the migration logic. This step should check that the token addresses for both the old and new strategies match before allowing any state changes or fund transfers. Adding a require statement similar to `require(oldStrategy.baseToken() == newStrategy.baseToken(), ""Base tokens do not match"")` would ensure that both strategies utilize the same token when migrating.

PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL VULNERABILITY
'''
The `withdraw` function relies on an assumption that it can withdraw the specified `_amount` from the `IConvexRewards` contract without verifying whether the full amount is available. If the underlying old strategy (cvxStaking) does not possess sufficient liquidity, the transaction will revert, potentially leaving behind unwithdrawn amounts. This can lead to partial migrations, where some funds remain locked within the old strategy, leading to potential loss of funds or incomplete migration.

Mitigation: Implement a check to ensure that the entire requested amount can be withdrawn. If it cannot, the function should attempt to withdraw the maximum possible amount and notify the caller about the actual amount withdrawn. This will help to gracefully handle cases where the requested amount exceeds available funds.

NO FALLBACK FUNCTION
'''
The contract does not define a fallback function or receive function to handle incoming ether transfers. As a result, any ether sent to this contract will be rejected, leading to accidental loss of ether. Users may attempt to send ether to this contract expecting it to handle it, but without a payable fallback function, these transactions will fail, and the ether will be lost. 

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider adding a payable fallback function or a receive function that can handle incoming ether. This will ensure that if ether is sent to the contract, it can be accepted and managed appropriately.

Recommended Fix:
```solidity
receive() external payable {
    // Logic to handle received ether, e.g., emit an event or accumulate balance.
}

UNLIMITED TOKEN APPROVAL
'''
The contract contains instances of unlimited token approval vulnerabilities. Specifically, during the execution of the `setApprovals()` function, the contract calls the `safeApprove()` function on multiple ERC20 tokens with the parameter `uint256(-1)`, which effectively translates to 2^256 - 1 (the maximum value for a uint256). This action grants an unlimited approval for another address (cvxStaking, crvDeposit, and rewards) to spend tokens on behalf of this contract.

While it is common in the past to approve unlimited token allowances to mitigate the risk of reverts due to potential race conditions in the `approve()` function, it is now recommended to avoid this practice as it can lead to security issues like the risk of token theft if the approved contract address is compromised.

Recommended mitigation:
Instead of approving an unlimited amount, the contract should only approve the exact amount required for a single transaction. Whenever an allowance is needed, it may rely on the `increaseAllowance()` method to adjust the allowance dynamically based on the transaction requirement. Moreover, it is essential to ensure that an allowance is set to zero before changing it to a different value, to mitigate the risk of race conditions.

VULNERABILITY: Unchecked User Inputs for Token Transfers
'''
The contract contains several functions where user inputs (such as addresses and token amounts) are not validated properly. For example, in the `rescueToken` function, the address `_to` is not checked to ensure it is not a zero address before proceeding with the token transfer. This could lead to tokens being sent to an invalid address, potentially causing a loss of tokens and unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `_amount` parameter in the `withdraw` function can take any value, including high amounts that exceed the staked balance. If users input an amount that is higher than the actual balance, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even loss of funds.

Recommended mitigations include:
1. In `rescueToken`, add a check for the `_to` address to ensure it is not zero: `require(_to != address(0), ""invalid recipient"");`
2. In the `withdraw` function, check that `_amount` is less than or equal to the balance before allowing withdrawals: `require(_amount <= IConvexRewards(cvxStaking).balanceOf(address(this)), ""withdrawal exceeds balance"");`
''' 

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Validations on `setPendingOwner` and `applyPendingOwner`
'''
In the `setPendingOwner` function, the `_po` address is not validated to ensure it is not the zero address. If a user sets a pending owner to a zero address, it can cause issues during ownership transfer. Additionally, in `applyPendingOwner`, there isn’t a validation to ensure that pending ownership was not set to a zero address, leading to an invalid ownership transfer.

Recommended mitigations include:
1. In `setPendingOwner`, add a check to ensure `_po` is not zero: `require(_po != address(0), ""pending owner cannot be zero"");`
2. Ensure similar validation in `applyPendingOwner` after checking `pendingOwner != address(0)` for robustness and clarity.
'''

VULNERABILITY: No Validation on Incentive Calculation
'''
In the `distribute` and `distributeOther` functions, the calculations for `incentiveAmount` do not validate whether the resulting amount is less than the balance of the respective tokens. If `callIncentive` is set too high (even up to 100), it could result in negative amounts due to the way it is calculated (though technically the subtraction in SafeMath prevents underflow).

Recommended mitigation includes:
1. Add a check to ensure that `incentiveAmount` does not exceed the respective balance: `require(incentiveAmount <= bal, ""incentive exceeds token balance"");`
