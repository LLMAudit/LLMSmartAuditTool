[2024-14-08 22:43:45 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Upon thorough inspection of the provided `EtherRocksHelper` smart contract, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on the presence of a withdrawal function and its security implications. Here are the findings:

1. **Withdrawal Function Check**: The contract does not contain any function that allows users to withdraw their deposited funds. There are no functions defined for withdrawing Ether or any other assets.

2. **Functions Related to Withdrawal**: I scanned the entire contract for any functions that would facilitate the withdrawal of funds. The functions present are primarily focused on transferring ownership of the EtherRocks NFTs and do not include any mechanism for users to withdraw funds.

3. **Best Practices Evaluation**: Since there is no withdrawal function present, there is no opportunity to evaluate its implementation against best practices such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or to ensure protection against reentrancy attacks.

4. **Impact Assessment**: The absence of a withdrawal function means that users who deposit funds into this contract have no means to retrieve their assets. This poses a significant risk as users may become locked into the contract without a way to access their funds. It is crucial for any contract handling user funds to implement a secure withdrawal mechanism to ensure user trust and safety.

Given the findings, I conclude with the following:

```
","<INFO> Lack of Authorization Identified.

```
LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The contract does not include a withdrawal function for the owner to retrieve any Ether or tokens that may be sent to the contract. This could lead to funds being locked in the contract indefinitely, especially if the contract is not designed to handle incoming Ether or tokens. To mitigate this, a withdrawal function should be implemented that allows the owner to withdraw any funds that are mistakenly sent to the contract. This function should be protected with the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the contract owner can execute it.
'''
```

[2024-14-08 22:43:49 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ","<INFO> Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.
```
POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract relies on the assumption that the `getRockInfo` function from the `IEtherRocks` interface will always return consistent and accurate data regarding the ownership of the rocks. If there are any discrepancies in the data returned by this function, it could lead to incorrect assumptions about the ownership of the rocks, especially in the `ownerOf` and `_transferFrom` functions. 

For example, if the `getRockInfo` function returns stale or incorrect data, the contract may incorrectly determine the owner of a rock or fail to execute a transfer correctly. This could lead to situations where the contract believes it owns a rock when it does not, or vice versa, resulting in potential loss of assets or locked funds.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement additional checks or validations to ensure the integrity of the data returned by `getRockInfo`. This could include:
1. Implementing a mechanism to verify the state of the rock ownership before performing any critical operations.
2. Adding events to log ownership changes and other critical state changes, allowing for easier tracking and debugging of state inconsistencies.
3. Considering a fallback mechanism or a way to handle unexpected states gracefully, such as reverting transactions when inconsistencies are detected.
'''
```

[2024-14-08 22:43:53 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,,,,,,"<INFO> Redundant Conditional Check Identified.

**REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK**
'''
In the `_transferFrom` function, there is a conditional check for the new owner of the rock after executing the transfer:
```solidity
(address newOwner,,,) = rocks.getRockInfo(_idx);
require(
    newOwner == address(this), //this should never be false
    ""EtherRocksHelper: not_deposited""
);
```
This check is redundant because the previous condition already ensures that if the account is not `address(this)`, the `_executeTransfer` function is called, which should guarantee that the rock is deposited in this contract. Therefore, the check for `newOwner` being `address(this)` is unnecessary and adds complexity and gas costs.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Remove the redundant check for `newOwner` after the transfer execution, as it is already implied by the previous logic. The code can be simplified by directly assuming that if the transfer was successful, the rock is now owned by this contract.
'''

[2024-14-08 22:44:18 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ","<INFO> External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY**
'''
The contract relies on the `IEtherRocks` interface to fetch critical data about the ownership of rocks through the `getRockInfo` function. This creates a dependency on the EtherRocks contract as an external oracle. If the EtherRocks contract is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the functionalities of the `EtherRocksHelper` contract could be adversely affected, leading to potential loss of assets or incorrect ownership transfers.

Additionally, there is no fallback mechanism implemented in the contract to handle cases where the call to `getRockInfo` fails or returns invalid data. This lack of error handling could allow adversaries to exploit the situation, potentially leading to denial of service or unexpected behavior in the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Implement a fallback mechanism to handle failures when calling the `getRockInfo` function. This could include reverting the transaction or providing a default behavior if the oracle call fails.
2. Consider using multiple oracles or a decentralized oracle service to reduce reliance on a single data source, thereby increasing the reliability and security of the data being used in the contract.
'''

[2024-14-08 22:44:23 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,"<INFO> Centralization Risk Identified.

**Centralized Ownership Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single owner (the NFTVault) to execute critical functions such as `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. This centralization of control poses a significant risk, as the owner address could be compromised, allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, transfer assets, or perform unauthorized actions. 

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for ownership or critical functions, requiring multiple parties to approve sensitive operations. This would distribute control and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
'''

**Renounce Ownership Prevention**
'''
The `renounceOwnership` function is overridden to prevent the owner from renouncing ownership, which could lead to the contract becoming unusable if the owner loses access. While this is intended to maintain control, it also centralizes power and creates a risk if the owner becomes incapacitated or malicious.

A recommended fix would be to implement a time-lock mechanism or a multi-signature requirement for ownership renouncement, allowing for a controlled transition of ownership while still providing a way to relinquish control if necessary.
'''

[2024-14-08 22:44:29 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN TRANSFER FUNCTIONS
'''
The `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions do not validate the input parameters `_from`, `_to`, and `_idx`. This lack of validation can lead to several issues:
1. The `_from` address could be a zero address, which would cause the transfer to fail or lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `_to` address could also be a zero address, which would result in the rock being sent to an invalid address.
3. The `_idx` parameter is not validated to ensure it is within the valid range of rock indices, which could lead to out-of-bounds access or unexpected behavior.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Add checks to ensure that `_from` and `_to` are not the zero address.
- Validate that `_idx` is within a valid range (e.g., greater than or equal to zero and less than the total number of rocks).
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN OWNER OF FUNCTION
'''
The `ownerOf` function retrieves the owner of a rock based on the `_idx` parameter without validating it. If `_idx` is invalid (e.g., negative or exceeds the total number of rocks), it could lead to unexpected behavior or revert the transaction.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Implement validation to ensure that `_idx` is within a valid range before calling `getRockInfo`.
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN GIFT ROCK FUNCTION
'''
In the `_transferFrom` function, the call to `rocks.giftRock(_idx, _to)` does not validate the `_to` address. If `_to` is a zero address, it could lead to the rock being sent to an invalid address.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Validate that `_to` is not a zero address before calling `giftRock`.

Ideas: "" Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.
```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Lack of Authorization. This type of vulnerability occurs when functions are accessible to unauthorized users, leading to potential misuse and exploitation of contract functionalities.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify all functions that modify the state of the contract or perform sensitive operations.
2. Determine if each identified function has appropriate access control mechanisms, such as `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdmin`, or other custom modifiers that restrict access to authorized users only.
3. Look for any functions that do not have explicit access control modifiers and assess whether their unrestricted access could lead to unauthorized actions.
4. Evaluate the current access control setup for potential bypasses or weaknesses that could allow unauthorized users to call restricted functions.
If you discover any Lack of Authorization vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> Lack of Authorization Identified.

```
LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The contract does not include a withdrawal function for the owner to retrieve any Ether or tokens that may be sent to the contract. This could lead to funds being locked in the contract indefinitely, especially if the contract is not designed to handle incoming Ether or tokens. To mitigate this, a withdrawal function should be implemented that allows the owner to withdraw any funds that are mistakenly sent to the contract. This function should be protected with the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the contract owner can execute it.

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""{task}"". Ideas: ""{ideas}"". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Potential Data Inconsistency. This type of vulnerability occurs when data may become inconsistent due to incorrect assumptions about how data is stored, accessed, or modified. Proceed with the following steps in your analysis: 1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any assumptions made about the behavior of storage and memory when handling data. 2. Look for patterns where data is copied from storage to memory, or vice versa, and determine if these operations are performed correctly. 3. Identify any functions or segments of code where temporary copies of data are made, and assess whether these copies are used appropriately without causing unintended modifications to the original data. 4. Evaluate the overall logic of data manipulation within the contract to ensure that all operations maintain consistency and integrity of the stored data. If you discover any Potential Data Inconsistency vulnerabilities, respond with: "" Potential Data Inconsistency Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code ''' If NO Potential Data Inconsistency vulnerabilities are found, respond only with: "" NO Potential Data Inconsistency."" |

LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The contract does not include a withdrawal function for the owner to retrieve any Ether or tokens that may be sent to the contract. This could lead to funds being locked in the contract indefinitely, especially if the contract is not designed to handle incoming Ether or tokens. To mitigate this, a withdrawal function should be implemented that allows the owner to withdraw any funds that are mistakenly sent to the contract. This function should be protected with the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the contract owner can execute it.

```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Potential Data Inconsistency. This type of vulnerability occurs when data may become inconsistent due to incorrect assumptions about how data is stored, accessed, or modified.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any assumptions made about the behavior of storage and memory when handling data.
2. Look for patterns where data is copied from storage to memory, or vice versa, and determine if these operations are performed correctly.
3. Identify any functions or segments of code where temporary copies of data are made, and assess whether these copies are used appropriately without causing unintended modifications to the original data.
4. Evaluate the overall logic of data manipulation within the contract to ensure that all operations maintain consistency and integrity of the stored data.
If you discover any Potential Data Inconsistency vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.
```
POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract relies on the assumption that the `getRockInfo` function from the `IEtherRocks` interface will always return consistent and accurate data regarding the ownership of the rocks. If there are any discrepancies in the data returned by this function, it could lead to incorrect assumptions about the ownership of the rocks, especially in the `ownerOf` and `_transferFrom` functions. 

For example, if the `getRockInfo` function returns stale or incorrect data, the contract may incorrectly determine the owner of a rock or fail to execute a transfer correctly. This could lead to situations where the contract believes it owns a rock when it does not, or vice versa, resulting in potential loss of assets or locked funds.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement additional checks or validations to ensure the integrity of the data returned by `getRockInfo`. This could include:
1. Implementing a mechanism to verify the state of the rock ownership before performing any critical operations.
2. Adding events to log ownership changes and other critical state changes, allowing for easier tracking and debugging of state inconsistencies.
3. Considering a fallback mechanism or a way to handle unexpected states gracefully, such as reverting transactions when inconsistencies are detected.

Ideas: "" Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.

POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract relies on the assumption that the `getRockInfo` function from the `IEtherRocks` interface will always return consistent and accurate data regarding the ownership of the rocks. If there are any discrepancies in the data returned by this function, it could lead to incorrect assumptions about the ownership of the rocks, especially in the `ownerOf` and `_transferFrom` functions. 

For example, if the `getRockInfo` function returns stale or incorrect data, the contract may incorrectly determine the owner of a rock or fail to execute a transfer correctly. This could lead to situations where the contract believes it owns a rock when it does not, or vice versa, resulting in potential loss of assets or locked funds.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement additional checks or validations to ensure the integrity of the data returned by `getRockInfo`. This could include:
1. Implementing a mechanism to verify the state of the rock ownership before performing any critical operations.
2. Adding events to log ownership changes and other critical state changes, allowing for easier tracking and debugging of state inconsistencies.
3. Considering a fallback mechanism or a way to handle unexpected states gracefully, such as reverting transactions when inconsistencies are detected.
'''
```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Hash Collision. This type of vulnerability occurs when different inputs produce the same hash due to improper handling of concatenated values, leading to potential security issues.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any functions that generate hashes from input values.
2. Look for patterns where multiple input values are concatenated without clear delimiters before hashing. Pay special attention to the use of `abi.encodePacked` for concatenation.
3. Determine if the concatenated inputs can produce the same hash for different combinations of input values, leading to potential hash collisions.
4. Evaluate the logic for generating and handling hashes within the contract to ensure that the potential for hash collisions is minimized.
If you discover any Hash Collision vulnerabilities, respond with: """,,,,,,,"<INFO> Redundant Conditional Check Identified.

**REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK**
'''
In the `_transferFrom` function, there is a conditional check for the new owner of the rock after executing the transfer:
```solidity
(address newOwner,,,) = rocks.getRockInfo(_idx);
require(
    newOwner == address(this), //this should never be false
    ""EtherRocksHelper: not_deposited""
);
```
This check is redundant because the previous condition already ensures that if the account is not `address(this)`, the `_executeTransfer` function is called, which should guarantee that the rock is deposited in this contract. Therefore, the check for `newOwner` being `address(this)` is unnecessary and adds complexity and gas costs.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Remove the redundant check for `newOwner` after the transfer execution, as it is already implied by the previous logic. The code can be simplified by directly assuming that if the transfer was successful, the rock is now owned by this contract.

Ideas: "" Redundant Conditional Check Identified.

**REDUNDANT CONDITIONAL CHECK**
'''
In the `_transferFrom` function, there is a conditional check for the new owner of the rock after executing the transfer:
```solidity
(address newOwner,,,) = rocks.getRockInfo(_idx);
require(
    newOwner == address(this), //this should never be false
    ""EtherRocksHelper: not_deposited""
);
```
This check is redundant because the previous condition already ensures that if the account is not `address(this)`, the `_executeTransfer` function is called, which should guarantee that the rock is deposited in this contract. Therefore, the check for `newOwner` being `address(this)` is unnecessary and adds complexity and gas costs.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Remove the redundant check for `newOwner` after the transfer execution, as it is already implied by the previous logic. The code can be simplified by directly assuming that if the transfer was successful, the rock is now owned by this contract.
'''"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to External Oracle Dependency. There are two main concerns related to External Oracle Dependency vulnerabilities:
1. Dependence on a single external oracle for critical data, which pertains to the reliability of the data source. If the oracle is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the contract's functionalities could be adversely affected.
2. Lack of fallback mechanisms, which can lead to the contract failing if the external oracle call fails or returns invalid data. This could be exploited by adversaries to disrupt the contract's operations.
If you identify reliance on a single external oracle for critical data, respond with: ""","<INFO> External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY**
'''
The contract relies on the `IEtherRocks` interface to fetch critical data about the ownership of rocks through the `getRockInfo` function. This creates a dependency on the EtherRocks contract as an external oracle. If the EtherRocks contract is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the functionalities of the `EtherRocksHelper` contract could be adversely affected, leading to potential loss of assets or incorrect ownership transfers.

Additionally, there is no fallback mechanism implemented in the contract to handle cases where the call to `getRockInfo` fails or returns invalid data. This lack of error handling could allow adversaries to exploit the situation, potentially leading to denial of service or unexpected behavior in the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Implement a fallback mechanism to handle failures when calling the `getRockInfo` function. This could include reverting the transaction or providing a default behavior if the oracle call fails.
2. Consider using multiple oracles or a decentralized oracle service to reduce reliance on a single data source, thereby increasing the reliability and security of the data being used in the contract.

Ideas: "" External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY**
'''
The contract relies on the `IEtherRocks` interface to fetch critical data about the ownership of rocks through the `getRockInfo` function. This creates a dependency on the EtherRocks contract as an external oracle. If the EtherRocks contract is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the functionalities of the `EtherRocksHelper` contract could be adversely affected, leading to potential loss of assets or incorrect ownership transfers.

Additionally, there is no fallback mechanism implemented in the contract to handle cases where the call to `getRockInfo` fails or returns invalid data. This lack of error handling could allow adversaries to exploit the situation, potentially leading to denial of service or unexpected behavior in the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
1. Implement a fallback mechanism to handle failures when calling the `getRockInfo` function. This could include reverting the transaction or providing a default behavior if the oracle call fails.
2. Consider using multiple oracles or a decentralized oracle service to reduce reliance on a single data source, thereby increasing the reliability and security of the data being used in the contract.
'''"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Ownership Hijacking. There is one main concern related to this vulnerability:
1. The changeOwner function allows any address to change the owner of the contract without any authorization checks. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract.
If you identify Lack of Authorization in the changeOwner function, respond with: """,,"<INFO> Centralization Risk Identified.

**Centralized Ownership Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single owner (the NFTVault) to execute critical functions such as `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. This centralization of control poses a significant risk, as the owner address could be compromised, allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, transfer assets, or perform unauthorized actions. 

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for ownership or critical functions, requiring multiple parties to approve sensitive operations. This would distribute control and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
'''

**Renounce Ownership Prevention**
'''
The `renounceOwnership` function is overridden to prevent the owner from renouncing ownership, which could lead to the contract becoming unusable if the owner loses access. While this is intended to maintain control, it also centralizes power and creates a risk if the owner becomes incapacitated or malicious.

A recommended fix would be to implement a time-lock mechanism or a multi-signature requirement for ownership renouncement, allowing for a controlled transition of ownership while still providing a way to relinquish control if necessary.

Ideas: "" Centralization Risk Identified.

**Centralized Ownership Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single owner (the NFTVault) to execute critical functions such as `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. This centralization of control poses a significant risk, as the owner address could be compromised, allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, transfer assets, or perform unauthorized actions. 

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for ownership or critical functions, requiring multiple parties to approve sensitive operations. This would distribute control and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
'''

**Renounce Ownership Prevention**
'''
The `renounceOwnership` function is overridden to prevent the owner from renouncing ownership, which could lead to the contract becoming unusable if the owner loses access. While this is intended to maintain control, it also centralizes power and creates a risk if the owner becomes incapacitated or malicious.

A recommended fix would be to implement a time-lock mechanism or a multi-signature requirement for ownership renouncement, allowing for a controlled transition of ownership while still providing a way to relinquish control if necessary.
'''"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Funding Rate Calculation Precision. There are two cases where the code may have Funding Rate Calculation Precision vulnerabilities:
1. Simplistic funding rate calculation that does not consider all necessary factors. This can lead to incorrect funding rates, which can be manipulated by providing incorrect input values. A robust funding rate calculation should account for various factors and validations to prevent exploitation.
2. Lack of input validation for critical parameters (e.g., spotPrice, markPrice) used in the funding rate calculation. Malicious actors could potentially manipulate these parameters to influence the funding rate calculation.
If you identify a Simplistic funding rate calculation or Lack of input validation, respond with: """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN TRANSFER FUNCTIONS
'''
The `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions do not validate the input parameters `_from`, `_to`, and `_idx`. This lack of validation can lead to several issues:
1. The `_from` address could be a zero address, which would cause the transfer to fail or lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The `_to` address could also be a zero address, which would result in the rock being sent to an invalid address.
3. The `_idx` parameter is not validated to ensure it is within the valid range of rock indices, which could lead to out-of-bounds access or unexpected behavior.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Add checks to ensure that `_from` and `_to` are not the zero address.
- Validate that `_idx` is within a valid range (e.g., greater than or equal to zero and less than the total number of rocks).
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN OWNER OF FUNCTION
'''
The `ownerOf` function retrieves the owner of a rock based on the `_idx` parameter without validating it. If `_idx` is invalid (e.g., negative or exceeds the total number of rocks), it could lead to unexpected behavior or revert the transaction.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Implement validation to ensure that `_idx` is within a valid range before calling `getRockInfo`.
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN GIFT ROCK FUNCTION
'''
In the `_transferFrom` function, the call to `rocks.giftRock(_idx, _to)` does not validate the `_to` address. If `_to` is a zero address, it could lead to the rock being sent to an invalid address.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Validate that `_to` is not a zero address before calling `giftRock`.

As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
