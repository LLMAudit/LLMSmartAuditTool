"<INFO> Integer Overflow/Underflow Identified.

```
INTEGER OVERFLOW/UNDERFLOW
'''
The contract does not currently utilize the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. This poses a risk of integer overflow or underflow when performing calculations, especially in functions that handle user stakes, rewards, and total balances. For instance, if a user stakes a large amount, the addition to their stake could exceed the maximum value for a uint256, leading to an overflow. Similarly, subtracting from a user's stake could result in an underflow if the stake is already zero.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to import and use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin for all arithmetic operations. This will ensure that any overflow or underflow is caught and revert the transaction, preventing unintended consequences. For example, replace:

```
uint256 newStake = userInfo[_user].stake + amount;
```

with:

```
uint256 newStake = userInfo[_user].stake.add(amount);
```

This should be applied to all arithmetic operations throughout the contract.

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""{task}"". Ideas: ""{ideas}"". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Reentrancy. Reentrancy vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When the contract makes an external call to another contract or address, and that call can re-enter the original contract before the initial function execution is complete. 2. When state changes in the contract are performed after an external call, allowing reentrant calls to manipulate the contract's state. 3. When there are no proper mechanisms such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where external calls are made that could lead to reentrancy issues.   Examine critical functions, particularly those involving Ether transfers, token transfers, and balance updates, to ensure they have proper checks in place.   Verify that the contract uses the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.   If you identify an external call to untrusted contracts before updating state variables, respond with: "" Reentrancy Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code ''' If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "" NO Reentrancy."" |

INTEGER OVERFLOW/UNDERFLOW
'''
The contract does not currently utilize the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations. This poses a risk of integer overflow or underflow when performing calculations, especially in functions that handle user stakes, rewards, and total balances. For instance, if a user stakes a large amount, the addition to their stake could exceed the maximum value for a uint256, leading to an overflow. Similarly, subtracting from a user's stake could result in an underflow if the stake is already zero.

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to import and use the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin for all arithmetic operations. This will ensure that any overflow or underflow is caught and revert the transaction, preventing unintended consequences. For example, replace:

```
uint256 newStake = userInfo[_user].stake + amount;
```

with:

```
uint256 newStake = userInfo[_user].stake.add(amount);
```

This should be applied to all arithmetic operations throughout the contract.

As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Reentrancy. Reentrancy vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When the contract makes an external call to another contract or address, and that call can re-enter the original contract before the initial function execution is complete.
2. When state changes in the contract are performed after an external call, allowing reentrant calls to manipulate the contract's state.
3. When there are no proper mechanisms such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where external calls are made that could lead to reentrancy issues.

2. Examine critical functions, particularly those involving Ether transfers, token transfers, and balance updates, to ensure they have proper checks in place.

3. Verify that the contract uses the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.
