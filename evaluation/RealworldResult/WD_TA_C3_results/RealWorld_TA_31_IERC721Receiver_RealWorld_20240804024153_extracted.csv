VULNERABILITY: Lack of Withdrawal Mechanism
'''
The provided contract code is an interface for the ERC721 token receiver, which primarily defines the `onERC721Received` function. However, it does not include any functions for users to withdraw their deposited funds or tokens. This absence of a withdrawal mechanism poses a significant risk to users, as they cannot retrieve their assets from the contract once deposited. 

To mitigate this issue, it is essential to implement a secure withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their funds or tokens safely. This function should adhere to best practices, including:

1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that state changes (like updating balances) occur before any external calls (like transferring Ether or tokens).
2. **Reentrancy Guard**: Implement a mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks, such as using a mutex or the OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard.
3. **Access Control**: Ensure that only the rightful owner of the funds can initiate a withdrawal.

Example of a secure withdrawal function:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, ""Insufficient balance"");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    msg.sender.transfer(amount);
