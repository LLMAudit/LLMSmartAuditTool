CENTRALIZATION RISK
'''
The provided contract does not implement any ownership or access control mechanisms, which means that the address that deploys the contract (msg.sender) will have full control over the total supply of tokens minted. If this address is compromised, an attacker could potentially mint an unlimited amount of tokens, leading to inflation and loss of value for token holders. 

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for critical operations or using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract to restrict access to certain functions. However, since the task specifies no upgrade code, it is recommended to ensure that the contract is deployed in a way that limits the ability to mint new tokens after the initial supply is set, or to implement a mechanism that allows for community governance over critical functions.
