contract NoMochiFeePool is IFeePool {

Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract and identify areas for potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Access Control for Withdraw Function**: Currently, the `withdraw` function can be called by anyone. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if the contract holds significant funds. We should consider adding access control to restrict this function to the `withdrawer` only.

2. **Event Emission**: The contract lacks events for important actions such as `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer`. Emitting events can help with tracking and monitoring contract activity, which is crucial for transparency and debugging.

3. **Reentrancy Protection**: The `withdraw` function directly transfers tokens to the `withdrawer`. To prevent potential reentrancy attacks, we should implement a reentrancy guard or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

4. **Input Validation**: In the `changeWithdrawer` function, we should validate that the new withdrawer address is not zero. This prevents the contract from being left without a valid withdrawer.

5. **Gas Optimization**: We can optimize the `withdraw` function by caching the balance in a local variable before the transfer call. This reduces the number of external calls and can save gas.

6. **Upgradeability**: If the contract is intended to be used long-term, we might want to consider implementing an upgradeable pattern (like the proxy pattern) to allow for future enhancements without losing state.

7. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding more comments and documentation to the code can improve readability and maintainability, especially for future developers who may work on this contract.

Which of these suggestions do you find most impactful, or do you have any additional ideas to contribute?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract and identify areas for potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Access Control for Withdraw Function**: Currently, the `withdraw` function can be called by anyone. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if the contract holds significant funds. We should consider adding access control to restrict this function to the `withdrawer` only.
2. **Event Emission**: The contract lacks events for important actions such as `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer`. Emitting events can help with tracking and monitoring contract activity, which is crucial for transparency and debugging.
3. **Reentrancy Protection**: The `withdraw` function directly transfers tokens to the `withdrawer`. To prevent potential reentrancy attacks, we should implement a reentrancy guard or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
4. **Input Validation**: In the `changeWithdrawer` function, we should validate that the new withdrawer address is not zero. This prevents the contract from being left without a valid withdrawer.
5. **Gas Optimization**: We can optimize the `withdraw` function by caching the balance in a local variable before the transfer call. This reduces the number of external calls and can save gas.
6. **Upgradeability**: If the contract is intended to be used long-term, we might want to consider implementing an upgradeable pattern (like the proxy pattern) to allow for future enhancements without losing state.
7. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding more comments and documentation to the code can improve readability and maintainability, especially for future developers who may work on this contract.
Which of these suggestions do you find most impactful, or do you have any additional ideas to contribute? Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control for Withdraw Function
```
The `withdraw` function currently allows any user to call it, which means that anyone can withdraw funds from the contract. This poses a significant risk, as malicious actors could exploit this to drain the contract's balance. The function should be restricted to only allow the designated `withdrawer` to execute it.

**Mitigation:** Implement an access control check in the `withdraw` function to ensure that only the `withdrawer` can call it. For example:
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    require(msg.sender == withdrawer, "Not withdrawer");
    ...
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Event Emission
```
The contract does not emit any events for critical state changes such as withdrawals or changes to the withdrawer address. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track contract activity and can hinder debugging efforts.

**Mitigation:** Emit events in the `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer` functions to log these actions. For example:
```solidity
event Withdraw(address indexed withdrawer, uint256 amount);
event WithdrawerChanged(address indexed oldWithdrawer, address indexed newWithdrawer);

function withdraw() external {
    ...
    emit Withdraw(withdrawer, amount);
}

function changeWithdrawer(address _withdrawer) external {
    ...
    emit WithdrawerChanged(withdrawer, _withdrawer);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk
```
The `withdraw` function transfers funds to the `withdrawer` before updating any state variables. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where the `withdrawer` could call `withdraw` again before the first call completes, potentially draining the contract.

**Mitigation:** Implement a reentrancy guard or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. For example:
```solidity
function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
    uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
    engine.usdm().transfer(withdrawer, balance);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Input Validation for Change Withdrawer
```
The `changeWithdrawer` function does not validate the new withdrawer address. If a zero address is set, it could lead to loss of funds, as no one would be able to withdraw from the contract.

**Mitigation:** Add a check to ensure that the new withdrawer address is not the zero address:
```solidity
require(_withdrawer != address(0), "Invalid withdrawer address");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
The `withdraw` function calls `engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this))` twice, which can be optimized to save gas costs.

**Mitigation:** Cache the balance in a local variable before the transfer call:
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
    engine.usdm().transfer(withdrawer, balance);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Consideration
```
The contract does not consider future upgrades, which could limit its functionality and adaptability to changing requirements.

**Mitigation:** Consider implementing a proxy pattern or using an upgradeable contract framework like OpenZeppelin's Upgrades library to allow for future enhancements without losing state.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Documentation and Comments
```
The contract lacks sufficient comments and documentation, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and its intended functionality.

**Mitigation:** Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each function, parameters, and any important logic. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities in the `NoMochiFeePool` Contract

1. **No Access Control on `withdraw` Function**:
   - The `withdraw` function allows any user to withdraw the entire balance of USDM tokens held by the contract. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if a malicious actor interacts with the contract.

2. **Lack of Event Emission**:
   - The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as withdrawals or changes to the withdrawer address. This lack of transparency can hinder tracking and auditing of contract activities.

3. **Potential for Governance Abuse**:
   - The `changeWithdrawer` function can only be called by the governance address. If the governance mechanism is compromised or if the governance address is malicious, it could lead to unauthorized changes to the withdrawer address.

4. **No Validation of Withdrawer Address**:
   - The contract does not validate the `_withdrawer` address in the constructor or in the `changeWithdrawer` function. This could lead to scenarios where the withdrawer is set to a zero address or an invalid address, making it impossible to withdraw funds.

5. **No Mechanism for Emergency Pausing**:
   - There is no emergency stop mechanism (circuit breaker) in place. In case of a vulnerability or exploit, there is no way to pause the contract to prevent further damage.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `NoMochiFeePool` contract presents several security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not addressed. The most critical issue is the lack of access control on the `withdraw` function, which allows any user to withdraw funds from the contract. This could lead to a total loss of funds if the contract is interacted with by a malicious actor.

Additionally, the absence of event emissions for key actions reduces the transparency and traceability of contract operations, making it difficult for stakeholders to monitor activities. The governance mechanism, while intended to provide control over the contract, could also be a point of failure if the governance address is compromised.

The lack of validation for the withdrawer address poses a risk of setting it to an invalid address, which could lock funds indefinitely. Furthermore, the absence of an emergency pausing mechanism means that in the event of a discovered vulnerability, there is no way to halt contract operations to mitigate potential losses.

In conclusion, while the `NoMochiFeePool` contract implements basic functionality, it requires significant improvements in security practices. Implementing access control, event emissions, address validation, and an emergency stop mechanism would greatly enhance the security posture of the contract. It is recommended to conduct a thorough review and implement these changes before deploying the contract to a live environment.

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control for Withdraw Function
```
The `withdraw` function currently allows any user to call it and withdraw funds from the contract. This poses a significant security risk, as any malicious actor could execute this function and drain the contract's balance. The function should be restricted to only allow the designated `withdrawer` to execute it.

**Mitigation:** Implement a check to ensure that `msg.sender` is equal to `withdrawer` before allowing the withdrawal to proceed. This can be done by adding a `require` statement at the beginning of the `withdraw` function.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Event Emission
```
The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer`. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for external observers to track important state changes and can hinder debugging and monitoring efforts.

**Mitigation:** Emit events in the `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer` functions to log these actions. For example, create events like `Withdraw(address indexed withdrawer, uint256 amount)` and `WithdrawerChanged(address indexed oldWithdrawer, address indexed newWithdrawer)`.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk
```
The `withdraw` function transfers tokens to the `withdrawer` without any checks or state updates before the transfer. This can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `usdm().transfer` function calls back into the `withdraw` function, allowing the attacker to withdraw more than intended.

**Mitigation:** Implement a reentrancy guard or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. First, update the state (if applicable) and then perform the transfer. Alternatively, use a mutex to prevent reentrant calls.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Input Validation for Withdrawer Address
```
The `changeWithdrawer` function does not validate the new withdrawer address. If a zero address is set as the new withdrawer, it could lead to loss of funds, as no one would be able to withdraw from the contract.

**Mitigation:** Add a check to ensure that the new withdrawer address is not the zero address before updating the `withdrawer` variable. This can be done using a `require` statement.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
In the `withdraw` function, the balance of the contract is fetched twice when calling `engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this))`. This can be optimized by caching the balance in a local variable, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.

**Mitigation:** Store the balance in a local variable before the transfer call, like so:
```
```solidity
uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
engine.usdm().transfer(withdrawer, balance);
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Consideration
```
The contract does not currently implement any upgradeability pattern, which could limit future enhancements or bug fixes. If the logic needs to be changed, a new contract would have to be deployed, and users would need to migrate their funds.

**Mitigation:** Consider implementing a proxy pattern or using a library like OpenZeppelin's Upgrades to allow for future upgrades without losing state or requiring users to migrate.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Documentation and Comments
```
The contract lacks sufficient comments and documentation, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and its intended functionality. This can lead to misuse or errors during future modifications.

**Mitigation:** Add comments explaining the purpose of each function, the parameters, and any important logic. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

**Mitigation:** Emit events in the `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer` functions to log these actions. For example, create events like `Withdraw(address indexed withdrawer, uint256 amount)` and `WithdrawerChanged(address indexed oldWithdrawer, address indexed newWithdrawer)`.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk
```
The `withdraw` function transfers tokens to the `withdrawer` without any checks or state updates before the transfer. This can lead to a reentrancy attack if the `usdm().transfer` function calls back into the `withdraw` function, allowing the attacker to withdraw more than intended.

**Mitigation:** Implement a reentrancy guard or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. First, update the state (if applicable) and then perform the transfer. Alternatively, use a mutex to prevent reentrant calls.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Input Validation for Withdrawer Address
```
The `changeWithdrawer` function does not validate the new withdrawer address. If a zero address is set as the new withdrawer, it could lead to loss of funds, as no one would be able to withdraw from the contract.

**Mitigation:** Add a check to ensure that the new withdrawer address is not the zero address before updating the `withdrawer` variable. This can be done using a `require` statement.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
In the `withdraw` function, the balance of the contract is fetched twice when calling `engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this))`. This can be optimized by caching the balance in a local variable, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.

**Mitigation:** Store the balance in a local variable before the transfer call, like so:
```
```solidity
uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
engine.usdm().transfer(withdrawer, balance);
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Consideration
```
The contract does not currently implement any upgradeability pattern, which could limit future enhancements or bug fixes. If the logic needs to be changed, a new contract would have to be deployed, and users would need to migrate their funds.

**Mitigation:** Consider implementing a proxy pattern or using a library like OpenZeppelin's Upgrades to allow for future upgrades without losing state or requiring users to migrate.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Documentation and Comments
```
The contract lacks sufficient comments and documentation, which can make it difficult for other developers to understand the code and its intended functionality. This can lead to misuse or errors during future modifications.

**Mitigation:** Add comments explaining the purpose of each function, the parameters, and any important logic. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract code for `NoMochiFeePool`, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities identified within the contract:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **No Access Control on Withdraw Function**:
   - The `withdraw` function allows any user to call it and withdraw the entire balance of USDM tokens held by the contract. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if the contract is misconfigured or if the `withdrawer` address is compromised.

2. **Lack of Event Emission**:
   - The `withdraw` function does not emit any events upon execution. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track withdrawals and monitor contract activity, which is essential for auditing and debugging.

3. **Governance Control**:
   - The `changeWithdrawer` function can only be called by the governance address. While this is a good practice, if the governance mechanism is compromised, an attacker could change the withdrawer address to one they control, leading to potential fund theft.

4. **No Validation on Withdrawer Address**:
   - The contract does not validate the `_withdrawer` address in the constructor or in the `changeWithdrawer` function. If an invalid address (like the zero address) is set, it could lead to loss of funds as no one would be able to withdraw them.

5. **Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability**:
   - Although the `withdraw` function transfers tokens after checking the balance, it does not implement any reentrancy protection mechanisms (like the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a reentrancy guard). This could allow an attacker to exploit the contract if they control the `withdrawer` address.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `NoMochiFeePool` contract implements a fee pool mechanism but exhibits several security vulnerabilities that could jeopardize the safety of funds and the integrity of the contract. The most critical issue is the lack of access control on the `withdraw` function, which allows any user to withdraw funds, potentially leading to unauthorized access and loss of assets.

Additionally, the absence of event emissions for critical functions like `withdraw` limits the ability to track contract activity, making it harder to audit and monitor. The governance mechanism, while providing some level of control, introduces a single point of failure if compromised.

Moreover, the contract lacks validation for the withdrawer address, which could lead to scenarios where funds are irretrievable. Lastly, the absence of reentrancy protection exposes the contract to potential attacks, especially if the withdrawer is a malicious contract.

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Access Control**: Introduce access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can call the `withdraw` function.
2. **Emit Events**: Add event emissions for critical functions to enhance transparency and facilitate tracking of contract interactions.
3. **Validate Addresses**: Ensure that the withdrawer address is valid and not the zero address during initialization and updates.
4. **Add Reentrancy Protection**: Implement reentrancy guards or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to mitigate reentrancy risks.
5. **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly audit the contract and its dependencies to identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the `NoMochiFeePool` contract can be made more secure and reliable for its intended use.

Here is a new customer's task: // SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../interfaces/IFeePool.sol";
import "../interfaces/IMochiEngine.sol";

contract NoMochiFeePool is IFeePool {
    IMochiEngine public immutable engine;
    address public withdrawer;

    constructor(address _withdrawer, address _engine) {
        engine = IMochiEngine(_engine);
        withdrawer = _withdrawer;
    }

    function updateReserve() external override {
        // no-op
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        engine.usdm().transfer(
            withdrawer,
            engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this))
        );
    }

    function changeWithdrawer(address _withdrawer) external {
        require(msg.sender == engine.governance(), "!gov");
        withdrawer = _withdrawer;
    }
}
.]

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control on Withdraw Function
```
The `withdraw` function currently allows any user to call it, which means that anyone can withdraw the entire balance of USDM tokens held by the contract. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and potential loss of funds. To mitigate this, the `withdraw` function should be restricted to only allow the designated `withdrawer` to execute it.

Recommended Fix:
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    require(msg.sender == withdrawer, "Not withdrawer");
    ...
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as `withdraw` and `changeWithdrawer`. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track actions on the contract, which is essential for auditing and monitoring purposes.

Recommended Fix:
Add event declarations and emit them in the respective functions:
```solidity
event Withdraw(address indexed withdrawer, uint256 amount);
event WithdrawerChanged(address indexed oldWithdrawer, address indexed newWithdrawer);

function withdraw() external {
    ...
    emit Withdraw(withdrawer, amount);
}

function changeWithdrawer(address _withdrawer) external {
    ...
    emit WithdrawerChanged(withdrawer, _withdrawer);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk
```
The `withdraw` function directly transfers tokens to the `withdrawer` without any protection against reentrancy attacks. An attacker could exploit this by calling the `withdraw` function recursively before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract.

Recommended Fix:
Implement a reentrancy guard or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:
```solidity
function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
    uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
    ...
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Input Validation for ChangeWithdrawer Function
```
The `changeWithdrawer` function does not validate that the new withdrawer address is not a zero address. Setting the withdrawer to a zero address could lock funds, as no one would be able to withdraw them.

Recommended Fix:
Add a check to ensure the new withdrawer address is valid:
```solidity
require(_withdrawer != address(0), "Invalid withdrawer address");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
In the `withdraw` function, the balance of USDM tokens is fetched multiple times. This can be optimized by caching the balance in a local variable before the transfer call, which reduces gas costs and improves efficiency.

Recommended Fix:
```solidity
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 balance = engine.usdm().balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
    engine.usdm().transfer(withdrawer, balance);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Considerations
```
The current contract does not consider upgradeability, which may limit future enhancements or bug fixes. If the contract needs to be upgraded, it would require redeployment and migration of funds.

Recommended Fix:
Consider implementing a proxy pattern or using a library like OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts to allow for future upgrades without losing state or funds.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Documentation and Comments
```
The contract lacks sufficient comments and documentation, which can hinder understanding and maintenance. Clear documentation is essential for future developers and auditors to comprehend the contract's functionality and design.

Recommended Fix:
Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and any important logic within the contract.

Based on the provided smart contract code for `NoMochiFeePool`, here is a summary of the identified security vulnerabilities and a comprehensive analysis report:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **No Access Control on Withdraw Function**:
   - The `withdraw` function allows any user to withdraw the entire balance of USDM tokens held by the contract. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawals if a malicious actor calls this function.

2. **Lack of Event Emission**:
   - The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as withdrawals or changes to the withdrawer address. This lack of transparency can hinder tracking and auditing of contract activities.

3. **Potential Governance Misconfiguration**:
   - The `changeWithdrawer` function allows only the governance address to change the withdrawer. If the governance address is compromised, an attacker could change the withdrawer to their own address, leading to potential fund theft.

4. **No Validation on Withdrawer Address**:
   - The contract does not validate the `_withdrawer` address in the constructor or the `changeWithdrawer` function. This could lead to scenarios where the withdrawer is set to a zero address or an invalid address, making it impossible to withdraw funds.

5. **No Fallback or Receive Function**:
   - The contract does not implement a fallback or receive function, which means it cannot accept ETH. While this may not be a direct vulnerability, it limits the contract's functionality in scenarios where ETH might need to be accepted.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `NoMochiFeePool` contract implements a fee pool mechanism but exhibits several security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not addressed. The most critical issue is the lack of access control on the `withdraw` function, which allows any user to withdraw funds, potentially leading to total loss of assets held by the contract. 

Additionally, the absence of event emissions for significant actions reduces the transparency of the contract's operations, making it difficult for users and auditors to track activities. The governance mechanism, while intended to provide control over the withdrawer address, poses risks if the governance address is compromised. 

Furthermore, the contract lacks validation for the withdrawer address, which could lead to operational issues if an invalid address is set. Lastly, the absence of a fallback or receive function limits the contract's ability to handle ETH, which may be a consideration for future enhancements.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to implement the following changes:
- Introduce access control mechanisms for the `withdraw` function to restrict withdrawals to the designated withdrawer only.
- Emit events for withdrawals and changes to the withdrawer address to enhance transparency.
- Validate the withdrawer address to ensure it is not a zero address or an invalid address.
- Consider implementing a fallback or receive function if the contract needs to handle ETH in the future.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the contract can be made more secure and reliable for users.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../interfaces/IFeePool.sol";
import "../interfaces/IMochiEngine.sol";

contract NoMochiFeePool is IFeePool {
    IMochiEngine public immutable engine;
    address public withdrawer;

    constructor(address _withdrawer, address _engine) {

Based on the provided information and existing test reports, here is a summary of the identified bugs and issues within the contract code:

1. Lack of Access Control:
   - The `changeWithdrawer` function allows any caller to change the `withdrawer` address without proper access control. It should only be accessible to the `governance` address of the `engine`.

2. Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability:
   - The `withdraw` function transfers tokens to the `withdrawer` address without using the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks.

3. Lack of Functionality:
   - The `updateReserve` function is implemented as a no-op, which may indicate missing or incomplete functionality in the contract.

Comprehensive Test Report Summary:
- The contract `NoMochiFeePool` lacks proper access control in the `changeWithdrawer` function, allowing unauthorized users to change the `withdrawer` address.
- There is a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `withdraw` function due to the direct token transfer without following best practices.
- The `updateReserve` function does not perform any meaningful operation, raising concerns about the completeness of the contract's functionality.

Recommendations:
1. Implement proper access control in the `changeWithdrawer` function to restrict access to authorized users only.
2. Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern in the `withdraw` function to prevent reentrancy attacks.
3. Review and enhance the functionality of the contract, especially the `updateReserve` function, to ensure all intended operations are correctly implemented.

It is recommended to address these issues to enhance the security and functionality of the `NoMochiFeePool` contract.
