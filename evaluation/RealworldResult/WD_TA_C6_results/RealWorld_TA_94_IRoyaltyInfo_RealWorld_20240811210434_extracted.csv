,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.

The provided contract code is an interface for the EIP-2981 NFT Royalty Standard, which does not include any functions for users to withdraw their deposited funds. This absence of a withdrawal mechanism poses significant risks for users who may expect to have control over their assets.

### Impact on Users:
Without a secure withdrawal function, users who deposit funds into the contract have no way to retrieve their assets. This can lead to potential loss of funds, as they may be locked indefinitely in the contract. Additionally, it creates a trust issue, as users may be hesitant to engage with a contract that does not provide a clear method for fund retrieval.

### Importance of a Secure Withdrawal Mechanism:
A secure withdrawal function is critical in any smart contract that handles user funds. It ensures that users can reclaim their assets when desired and protects against potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks. Implementing a withdrawal function following best practices is essential to maintain user trust and contract integrity.

### Recommended Mitigation:
To address the lack of a withdrawal function, the contract should be updated to include a secure withdrawal mechanism. This function should adhere to the following best practices:
1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that state changes are made before external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper access control to ensure that only authorized users can initiate withdrawals.
3. **Error Handling**: Use `require` statements to validate conditions before executing the withdrawal logic.

By incorporating these recommendations, the contract can provide a secure and reliable method for users to withdraw their funds.

As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Lack of Authorization. This type of vulnerability occurs when functions are accessible to unauthorized users, leading to potential misuse and exploitation of contract functionalities. Proceed with the following steps in your analysis: 1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify all functions that modify the state of the contract or perform sensitive operations. 2. Determine if each identified function has appropriate access control mechanisms, such as onlyOwner, onlyAdmin, or other custom modifiers that restrict access to authorized users only. 3. Look for any functions that do not have explicit access control modifiers and assess whether their unrestricted access could lead to unauthorized actions. 4. Evaluate the current access control setup for potential bypasses or weaknesses that could allow unauthorized users to call restricted functions.
