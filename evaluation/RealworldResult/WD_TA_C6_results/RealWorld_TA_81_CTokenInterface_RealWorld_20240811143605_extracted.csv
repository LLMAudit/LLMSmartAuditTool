UNLIMITED TOKEN APPROVAL
'''
The `approve` function allows users to set an allowance for a spender without any checks on the input values. If a user mistakenly or maliciously sets an allowance to a very high value (or even the maximum uint256 value), it can lead to potential abuse where the spender can drain the user's funds without further consent. This is particularly dangerous if the spender is a contract that the user does not fully trust.

Recommended Mitigation:
Implement a mechanism to limit the maximum allowance that can be set, or require the user to explicitly confirm high-value approvals. Additionally, consider using the ""increaseAllowance"" and ""decreaseAllowance"" pattern to manage allowances safely, which helps prevent the risk of race conditions and unintended unlimited approvals.
'''

ZERO ADDRESS CHECK
'''
In the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `seize` functions, there are no checks to ensure that the destination (`dst`) or source (`src`) addresses are not zero addresses. Transferring tokens to a zero address can lead to loss of tokens, as they would be irretrievable.

Recommended Mitigation:
Add require statements to check that the `dst` and `src` addresses are not zero addresses before proceeding with the transfer or approval logic. For example:
```
require(dst != address(0), ""Transfer to the zero address"");
```
'''

NEGATIVE VALUE CHECK
'''
In functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve`, there are no checks to ensure that the `amount` being transferred or approved is greater than zero. Allowing zero or negative values can lead to unexpected behavior or misuse of the contract.

Recommended Mitigation:
Add require statements to ensure that the `amount` is greater than zero. For example:
```
require(amount > 0, ""Amount must be greater than zero"");
```
'''

EXCEEDING BALANCE CHECK
'''
In the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, there are no checks to ensure that the sender has sufficient balance to perform the transfer. This can lead to failed transactions without clear feedback to the user.

Recommended Mitigation:
Before executing the transfer logic, check that the sender's balance is sufficient to cover the transfer amount. For example:
```
require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, ""Insufficient balance"");
```

As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2.

When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4.
