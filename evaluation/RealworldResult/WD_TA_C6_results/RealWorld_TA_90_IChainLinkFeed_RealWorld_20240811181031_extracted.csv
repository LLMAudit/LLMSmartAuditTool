DEPENDENCE ON A SINGLE EXTERNAL ORACLE
'''
The provided contract relies solely on the IChainLinkFeed interface to fetch the latest answer from an external oracle. This creates a critical dependency on the reliability and security of that single oracle. If the oracle is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the contract's functionalities that depend on this data could be adversely affected, leading to potential financial losses or unintended behavior.

Recommended Mitigation:
1. **Implement Multiple Oracles**: Use multiple oracle sources to fetch data and aggregate the results. This can help ensure that the contract can still function correctly even if one oracle fails or provides incorrect data.
2. **Data Validation**: Introduce mechanisms to validate the data received from the oracle. For example, set thresholds for acceptable values or implement a consensus mechanism among multiple oracles before accepting the data.
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Create fallback mechanisms that can handle failures in oracle calls. For instance, if the oracle call fails, the contract could revert to a previously stored value or use a default value to ensure continuity of operations.
