UNCHECKED EXTERNAL CALL VULNERABILITY
'''
The function `getUint112()` makes an external call to `MsgValue.getUint112()` without checking the success of the call. If the `MsgValue.getUint112()` function fails or reverts, the state of the `MsgValueCallee` contract will not be aware of this failure, potentially leading to unintended consequences or loss of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to check the return value of the external call. If `MsgValue.getUint112()` is a function that returns a value, ensure that the return value is checked before proceeding. If it does not return a value, consider using a `require` statement to ensure that the call was successful. For example:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = address(MsgValue).call(abi.encodeWithSignature(""getUint112()""));
require(success, ""External call failed"");
```

 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY**
'''
The contract `MsgValueCallee` relies on the `MsgValue.getUint112()` function, which is presumably an external call to an oracle or library that provides critical data. This creates a dependency on the reliability of the `MsgValue` library. If the oracle or library is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the functionality of the `MsgValueCallee` contract could be adversely affected, leading to potential financial losses or unexpected behavior.

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing the following recommendations:
1. **Use Multiple Oracles**: Instead of relying on a single oracle, aggregate data from multiple oracles to enhance reliability and reduce the risk of incorrect data.
2. **Implement Fallback Mechanisms**: Introduce fallback mechanisms that can handle failures in oracle calls. This could include default values, retries, or alternative data sources.
3. **Data Validation**: Implement checks to validate the data received from the oracle before using it in critical operations. This can help prevent the contract from acting on invalid or malicious data.
4. **Timeouts and Circuit Breakers**: Establish timeouts for oracle responses and circuit breakers that can halt operations if the oracle fails to respond within a specified timeframe.

[We are a specialized team that audits Solidity smart contracts using an advanced multi-agent system. Our approach combines the expertise of project management, smart contract counseling, auditing, and Solidity programming to deliver comprehensive and reliable contract assessments.
You are Security Analyst. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and share a common interest in collaborating to successfully execute a marketing strategy for a new customer.

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity =0.8.4;

import {SafeCast} from '@timeswap-labs/timeswap-v1-core/contracts/libraries/SafeCast.sol';
import {MsgValue} from '../libraries/MsgValue.sol';
contract MsgValueCallee{
    function getUint112() payable public{
        MsgValue.getUint112();
    }
}"".
Ideas: "" External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**EXTERNAL ORACLE DEPENDENCY**
'''
The contract `MsgValueCallee` relies on the `MsgValue.getUint112()` function, which is presumably an external call to an oracle or library that provides critical data. This creates a dependency on the reliability of the `MsgValue` library. If the oracle or library is compromised, provides incorrect data, or becomes unavailable, the functionality of the `MsgValueCallee` contract could be adversely affected, leading to potential financial losses or unexpected behavior.

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing the following recommendations:
1. **Use Multiple Oracles**: Instead of relying on a single oracle, aggregate data from multiple oracles to enhance reliability and reduce the risk of incorrect data.
2. **Implement Fallback Mechanisms**: Introduce fallback mechanisms that can handle failures in oracle calls. This could include default values, retries, or alternative data sources.
3. **Data Validation**: Implement checks to validate the data received from the oracle before using it in critical operations. This can help prevent the contract from acting on invalid or malicious data.
4. **Timeouts and Circuit Breakers**: Establish timeouts for oracle responses and circuit breakers that can halt operations if the oracle fails to respond within a specified timeframe.
'''"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Ownership Hijacking. There is one main concern related to this vulnerability:
1. The changeOwner function allows any address to change the owner of the contract without any authorization checks. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the contract.
If you identify Lack of Authorization in the changeOwner function, respond with: """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
