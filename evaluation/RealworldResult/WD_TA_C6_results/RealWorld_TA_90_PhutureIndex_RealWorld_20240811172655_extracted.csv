,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Price Manipulation Identified.

**VULNERABILITY NAME: Centralized Price Manipulation Risk**
'''
The contract relies on external contracts (specifically `INameRegistry` and `IFeePool`) to provide the index name, symbol, and AUM scaled per seconds rate. If these external contracts are controlled by a centralized authority, they can manipulate the token prices by altering the values returned by their functions. This could lead to unfair trading conditions, as the controlling entity could adjust prices to their advantage without any checks or balances in place.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:** 
To mitigate this risk, ensure that the external contracts are governed by a decentralized mechanism, such as a DAO, or implement a multi-signature wallet for critical functions. Additionally, consider implementing a price oracle system that aggregates prices from multiple sources to provide a more robust and tamper-resistant price determination mechanism.
'''

**VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Price Transparency**
'''
The contract does not provide a transparent mechanism for determining token prices, as it solely relies on the `IFeePool` contract's `AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf` function. If this function is not transparent or if its logic is not publicly verifiable, it could lead to exploitation by the controlling entity, who may adjust the AUM rate to manipulate the perceived value of the tokens.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:** 
Implement a decentralized price feed or oracle that aggregates price data from multiple sources. This would ensure that the price determination process is transparent and less susceptible to manipulation. Additionally, consider allowing community governance to oversee any changes to the pricing mechanisms.

 ",,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.
```

[2024-11-08 17:27:28 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Upon reviewing the provided smart contract code for the `PhutureIndex` contract, I have conducted a thorough analysis focusing on the presence and security of a withdrawal function. Here are my findings:

1. **Withdrawal Function Check**: The contract does not contain any function that allows users to withdraw their deposited funds. There are no functions explicitly designed for users to retrieve their assets from the contract.

2. **Scanning for Withdrawal Functions**: I searched through the contract for any functions related to withdrawing Ether or other assets. The contract primarily focuses on managing an AUM fee and does not implement any withdrawal logic.

3. **Evaluation of Withdrawal Logic**: Since there is no withdrawal function present, there is no logic to evaluate for security best practices such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or protection against reentrancy attacks.

4. **Impact Assessment**: The absence of a withdrawal function poses a significant risk to users who have deposited funds into the contract. Without a secure mechanism to withdraw their assets, users may be unable to access their funds, leading to potential loss of capital. It is crucial for any contract that handles user funds to implement a secure withdrawal mechanism to ensure user trust and safety.

Based on the analysis, I conclude with the following:

```
","<INFO> Lack of Authorization Identified.
```
LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The provided contract does not include a withdrawal function that allows users to retrieve their funds or tokens from the contract. This absence can lead to a situation where users are unable to access their assets, especially in cases where the contract may need to be paused or if a user wants to exit the system. Furthermore, without a proper withdrawal mechanism, users may be at risk of losing their funds if the contract encounters issues or if they wish to stop participating in the index.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their tokens or funds from the contract. This function should include appropriate access control to ensure that only the rightful owners of the tokens can initiate withdrawals. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to handle any fees or penalties associated with withdrawals, if applicable.

 ","<INFO> Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.
```
POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY IN FEE CALCULATION
'''
The contract relies on the `lastTransferTime` variable to calculate the time elapsed since the last transfer, which is used to compute the AUM fee. However, if the `lastTransferTime` is not properly initialized or updated in all relevant scenarios, it could lead to incorrect fee calculations. For instance, if a transfer occurs but the `lastTransferTime` is not updated due to an error or oversight, the next fee calculation could be based on stale data, leading to inconsistent or incorrect fee amounts being minted.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Ensure that `lastTransferTime` is initialized correctly in the constructor and updated consistently in all scenarios where a transfer occurs. Additionally, consider adding checks to validate that the state of `lastTransferTime` is consistent with the expected state of the contract, potentially using events to log changes to this variable for transparency.

[2024-11-08 17:27:33 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,,,,,"<INFO> Precision Loss Identified.

**Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**
'''
The contract contains arithmetic operations that may lead to precision loss, particularly in the `_chargeAUMFee` function. The calculation of the `fee` variable involves integer division, which can truncate values and lead to significant errors in the fee calculation. Specifically, the expression:

```solidity
uint fee = ((totalSupply() - balanceOf(factory)) *
    (AUMCalculationLibrary.rpow(
        IFeePool(_feePool).AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf(address(this)),
        timePassed,
        AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE
    ) - AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE)) / AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE;
```

Here, the division by `AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE` can result in precision loss, especially if the numerator is smaller than the denominator or if the values involved are not large enough to maintain precision after the division.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library that allows for more precise calculations without losing fractional values. Alternatively, you can scale the values before performing the division to ensure that precision is maintained throughout the calculation. For example, multiplying the numerator by a scaling factor before the division can help retain precision.

[2024-11-08 17:27:43 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,,,"<INFO> Centralization Risk Identified.

**Centralization Risk - Single Point of Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single registry address (`registry`) to fetch the index name and symbol through the `INameRegistry` interface. If this registry address is compromised or controlled by a single entity, it poses a significant risk as that entity can manipulate the index name and symbol at will. Additionally, the `_chargeAUMFee` function mints fees to a `factory` address, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `factory` address is controlled by a single entity, it could lead to potential abuse of power, allowing that entity to mint tokens without any checks or balances.

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for critical operations, such as setting the `registry` and `factory` addresses. This would require multiple signatures from different parties to execute sensitive functions, thus distributing control and reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

[2024-11-08 17:27:51 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN _transfer FUNCTION
'''
The _transfer function overrides the internal transfer logic but does not validate the input parameters _from, _to, and _value. This lack of validation can lead to several issues:
1. The _from address can be a zero address, which would result in transferring tokens from an invalid address.
2. The _to address can also be a zero address, leading to tokens being sent to an invalid recipient.
3. The _value parameter is not checked for being greater than zero, which could allow for a transfer of zero tokens, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.

To mitigate these issues, the following checks should be added at the beginning of the _transfer function:
- Require that _from and _to are not zero addresses.
- Require that _value is greater than zero.

Recommended implementation:
```solidity
require(_from != address(0), ""Transfer from the zero address"");
require(_to != address(0), ""Transfer to the zero address"");
require(_value > 0, ""Transfer value must be greater than zero"");
```
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN _chargeAUMFee FUNCTION
'''
The _chargeAUMFee function calculates and mints an AUM fee based on the time passed since the last transfer. However, it does not validate the _feePool address before using it to call IFeePool's AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf function. If an invalid or malicious address is passed, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even revert the transaction.

To mitigate this risk, a check should be added to ensure that the _feePool address is not a zero address before proceeding with the calculation.

Recommended implementation:
```solidity
require(_feePool != address(0), ""Fee pool address cannot be zero"");
```

The contract relies on external contracts (specifically `INameRegistry` and `IFeePool`) to provide the index name, symbol, and AUM scaled per seconds rate. If these external contracts are controlled by a centralized authority, they can manipulate the token prices by altering the values returned by their functions. This could lead to unfair trading conditions, as the controlling entity could adjust prices to their advantage without any checks or balances in place.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:** 
To mitigate this risk, ensure that the external contracts are governed by a decentralized mechanism, such as a DAO, or implement a multi-signature wallet for critical functions. Additionally, consider implementing a price oracle system that aggregates prices from multiple sources to provide a more robust and tamper-resistant price determination mechanism.

As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Assumption of Fixed-Length Array. There are two cases where the contract may have Assumption of Fixed-Length Array vulnerabilities:
1. When the contract incorrectly assumes that an array returned by a function has a fixed length, potentially leading to data corruption or out-of-bounds errors if the actual array length differs.
2. When the contract does not handle dynamic array lengths properly, causing incorrect data processing or logic errors.
If you identify all Assumption of Fixed-Length Array vulnerabilities, respond with: """,,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.

This type of vulnerability occurs when functions are accessible to unauthorized users, leading to potential misuse and exploitation of contract functionalities. Proceed with the following steps in your analysis: 1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify all functions that modify the state of the contract or perform sensitive operations. 2. Determine if each identified function has appropriate access control mechanisms, such as onlyOwner, onlyAdmin, or other custom modifiers that restrict access to authorized users only. 3. Look for any functions that do not have explicit access control modifiers and assess whether their unrestricted access could lead to unauthorized actions. 4. Evaluate the current access control setup for potential bypasses or weaknesses that could allow unauthorized users to call restricted functions. If you discover any Lack of Authorization vulnerabilities, respond with: "" Lack of Authorization Identified.""

Ideas: "" Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.
```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Lack of Authorization. This type of vulnerability occurs when functions are accessible to unauthorized users, leading to potential misuse and exploitation of contract functionalities.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify all functions that modify the state of the contract or perform sensitive operations.
2. Determine if each identified function has appropriate access control mechanisms, such as `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdmin`, or other custom modifiers that restrict access to authorized users only.
3. Look for any functions that do not have explicit access control modifiers and assess whether their unrestricted access could lead to unauthorized actions.
4. Evaluate the current access control setup for potential bypasses or weaknesses that could allow unauthorized users to call restricted functions.
If you discover any Lack of Authorization vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> Lack of Authorization Identified.
```
LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The provided contract does not include a withdrawal function that allows users to retrieve their funds or tokens from the contract. This absence can lead to a situation where users are unable to access their assets, especially in cases where the contract may need to be paused or if a user wants to exit the system. Furthermore, without a proper withdrawal mechanism, users may be at risk of losing their funds if the contract encounters issues or if they wish to stop participating in the index.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their tokens or funds from the contract. This function should include appropriate access control to ensure that only the rightful owners of the tokens can initiate withdrawals. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to handle any fees or penalties associated with withdrawals, if applicable.

As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Potential Data Inconsistency. This type of vulnerability occurs when data may become inconsistent due to incorrect assumptions about how data is stored, accessed, or modified. Proceed with the following steps in your analysis: 1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any assumptions made about the behavior of storage and memory when handling data. 2.

LACK OF WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION
'''
The provided contract does not include a withdrawal function that allows users to retrieve their funds or tokens from the contract. This absence can lead to a situation where users are unable to access their assets, especially in cases where the contract may need to be paused or if a user wants to exit the system. Furthermore, without a proper withdrawal mechanism, users may be at risk of losing their funds if the contract encounters issues or if they wish to stop participating in the index.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Implement a withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their tokens or funds from the contract. This function should include appropriate access control to ensure that only the rightful owners of the tokens can initiate withdrawals. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to handle any fees or penalties associated with withdrawals, if applicable.

```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Potential Data Inconsistency. This type of vulnerability occurs when data may become inconsistent due to incorrect assumptions about how data is stored, accessed, or modified.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any assumptions made about the behavior of storage and memory when handling data.
2. Look for patterns where data is copied from storage to memory, or vice versa, and determine if these operations are performed correctly.
3. Identify any functions or segments of code where temporary copies of data are made, and assess whether these copies are used appropriately without causing unintended modifications to the original data.
4. Evaluate the overall logic of data manipulation within the contract to ensure that all operations maintain consistency and integrity of the stored data.
If you discover any Potential Data Inconsistency vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.
```
POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY IN FEE CALCULATION
'''
The contract relies on the `lastTransferTime` variable to calculate the time elapsed since the last transfer, which is used to compute the AUM fee. However, if the `lastTransferTime` is not properly initialized or updated in all relevant scenarios, it could lead to incorrect fee calculations. For instance, if a transfer occurs but the `lastTransferTime` is not updated due to an error or oversight, the next fee calculation could be based on stale data, leading to inconsistent or incorrect fee amounts being minted.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Ensure that `lastTransferTime` is initialized correctly in the constructor and updated consistently in all scenarios where a transfer occurs. Additionally, consider adding checks to validate that the state of `lastTransferTime` is consistent with the expected state of the contract, potentially using events to log changes to this variable for transparency.

POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY IN FEE CALCULATION
'''
The contract relies on the `lastTransferTime` variable to calculate the time elapsed since the last transfer, which is used to compute the AUM fee. However, if the `lastTransferTime` is not properly initialized or updated in all relevant scenarios, it could lead to incorrect fee calculations. For instance, if a transfer occurs but the `lastTransferTime` is not updated due to an error or oversight, the next fee calculation could be based on stale data, leading to inconsistent or incorrect fee amounts being minted.

Recommended Mitigation/Fix:
Ensure that `lastTransferTime` is initialized correctly in the constructor and updated consistently in all scenarios where a transfer occurs. Additionally, consider adding checks to validate that the state of `lastTransferTime` is consistent with the expected state of the contract, potentially using events to log changes to this variable for transparency.

```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Hash Collision. This type of vulnerability occurs when different inputs produce the same hash due to improper handling of concatenated values, leading to potential security issues.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any functions that generate hashes from input values.
2. Look for patterns where multiple input values are concatenated without clear delimiters before hashing. Pay special attention to the use of `abi.encodePacked` for concatenation.
3. Determine if the concatenated inputs can produce the same hash for different combinations of input values, leading to potential hash collisions.
4. Evaluate the logic for generating and handling hashes within the contract to ensure that the potential for hash collisions is minimized.
If you discover any Hash Collision vulnerabilities, respond with: """,,,,,,"<INFO> Precision Loss Identified.

**Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**
'''
The contract contains arithmetic operations that may lead to precision loss, particularly in the `_chargeAUMFee` function. The calculation of the `fee` variable involves integer division, which can truncate values and lead to significant errors in the fee calculation. Specifically, the expression:

```solidity
uint fee = ((totalSupply() - balanceOf(factory)) *
    (AUMCalculationLibrary.rpow(
        IFeePool(_feePool).AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf(address(this)),
        timePassed,
        AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE
    ) - AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE)) / AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE;
```

Here, the division by `AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE` can result in precision loss, especially if the numerator is smaller than the denominator or if the values involved are not large enough to maintain precision after the division.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library that allows for more precise calculations without losing fractional values. Alternatively, you can scale the values before performing the division to ensure that precision is maintained throughout the calculation. For example, multiplying the numerator by a scaling factor before the division can help retain precision.

Ideas: "" Precision Loss Identified.

**Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**
'''
The contract contains arithmetic operations that may lead to precision loss, particularly in the `_chargeAUMFee` function. The calculation of the `fee` variable involves integer division, which can truncate values and lead to significant errors in the fee calculation. Specifically, the expression:

```solidity
uint fee = ((totalSupply() - balanceOf(factory)) *
    (AUMCalculationLibrary.rpow(
        IFeePool(_feePool).AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf(address(this)),
        timePassed,
        AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE
    ) - AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE)) / AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE;
```

Here, the division by `AUMCalculationLibrary.RATE_SCALE_BASE` can result in precision loss, especially if the numerator is smaller than the denominator or if the values involved are not large enough to maintain precision after the division.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library that allows for more precise calculations without losing fractional values. Alternatively, you can scale the values before performing the division to ensure that precision is maintained throughout the calculation. For example, multiplying the numerator by a scaling factor before the division can help retain precision.
'''"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Redundant Conditional Checks. There are specific cases where the code may have Redundant Conditional Check vulnerabilities:
1. Conditional checks that always evaluate to true or false, which add unnecessary complexity and gas costs to the code.
2. Conditions that duplicate checks already performed earlier in the code, leading to redundant operations and inefficient execution.
If you identify any redundant conditional checks, respond with: """,,,,"<INFO> Centralization Risk Identified.

**Centralization Risk - Single Point of Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single registry address (`registry`) to fetch the index name and symbol through the `INameRegistry` interface. If this registry address is compromised or controlled by a single entity, it poses a significant risk as that entity can manipulate the index name and symbol at will. Additionally, the `_chargeAUMFee` function mints fees to a `factory` address, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `factory` address is controlled by a single entity, it could lead to potential abuse of power, allowing that entity to mint tokens without any checks or balances.

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for critical operations, such as setting the `registry` and `factory` addresses. This would require multiple signatures from different parties to execute sensitive functions, thus distributing control and reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

**Centralization Risk - Single Point of Control**
'''
The contract relies on a single registry address (`registry`) to fetch the index name and symbol through the `INameRegistry` interface. If this registry address is compromised or controlled by a single entity, it poses a significant risk as that entity can manipulate the index name and symbol at will. Additionally, the `_chargeAUMFee` function mints fees to a `factory` address, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. If the `factory` address is controlled by a single entity, it could lead to potential abuse of power, allowing that entity to mint tokens without any checks or balances.

If you identify a Simplistic funding rate calculation or Lack of input validation, respond with: """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN _transfer FUNCTION
'''
The _transfer function overrides the internal transfer logic but does not validate the input parameters _from, _to, and _value. This lack of validation can lead to several issues:
1. The _from address can be a zero address, which would result in transferring tokens from an invalid address.
2. The _to address can also be a zero address, leading to tokens being sent to an invalid recipient.
3. The _value parameter is not checked for being greater than zero, which could allow for a transfer of zero tokens, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.

To mitigate these issues, the following checks should be added at the beginning of the _transfer function:
- Require that _from and _to are not zero addresses.
- Require that _value is greater than zero.

Recommended implementation:
```solidity
require(_from != address(0), ""Transfer from the zero address"");
require(_to != address(0), ""Transfer to the zero address"");
require(_value > 0, ""Transfer value must be greater than zero"");
```
'''
```

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN _chargeAUMFee FUNCTION
'''
The _chargeAUMFee function calculates and mints an AUM fee based on the time passed since the last transfer. However, it does not validate the _feePool address before using it to call IFeePool's AUMScaledPerSecondsRateOf function. If an invalid or malicious address is passed, it could lead to unexpected behavior or even revert the transaction.

To mitigate this risk, a check should be added to ensure that the _feePool address is not a zero address before proceeding with the calculation.

Recommended implementation:
```solidity
require(_feePool != address(0), ""Fee pool address cannot be zero"");
```

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."". Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics. If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: "" DoS Vulnerability Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, along with recommended mitigation measures or fixes that do not require code upgrades.

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."".
Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: """,
