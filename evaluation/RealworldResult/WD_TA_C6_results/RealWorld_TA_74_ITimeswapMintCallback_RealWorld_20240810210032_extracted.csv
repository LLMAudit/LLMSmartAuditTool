,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified. 

The provided contract code does not include any functions that allow users to withdraw their deposited funds. This absence poses a significant risk to users, as they have no means to retrieve their assets once deposited into the contract. 

### Importance of a Secure Withdrawal Mechanism:
1. **User Trust**: Users need assurance that they can access their funds at any time. A lack of withdrawal functionality can lead to distrust and deter users from interacting with the contract.
2. **Security Risks**: Without a withdrawal function, users are at risk of losing their funds if the contract encounters issues or if the contract owner becomes unreachable.
3. **Compliance and Best Practices**: Many regulatory frameworks require that users have control over their assets, including the ability to withdraw them.

### Recommended Mitigation:
To enhance the security and usability of the contract, it is crucial to implement a withdrawal function that allows users to securely withdraw their funds. This function should adhere to best practices, including:

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that state changes are made before external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only the rightful owner of the funds can initiate a withdrawal.
- **Event Emission**: Emit events upon successful withdrawals to provide transparency and traceability.

Implementing these measures will significantly improve the contract's security and user experience.
