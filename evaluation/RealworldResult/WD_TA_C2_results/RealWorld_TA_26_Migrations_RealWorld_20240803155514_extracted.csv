LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN setCompleted FUNCTION
'''
The `setCompleted` function allows the owner to set the `last_completed_migration` variable to any uint256 value provided as an input. However, there is no validation to ensure that the `completed` value is within a reasonable range or that it is not set to an invalid state. For example, if an attacker were to call this function with a very large number, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract's logic or state.

Recommended Mitigation:
Implement input validation to ensure that the `completed` value is greater than the current `last_completed_migration` value. This will prevent the owner from setting the migration to an earlier state or an arbitrary large number that could disrupt the contract's intended functionality.

Example of validation:
```solidity
require(completed > last_completed_migration, ""New migration must be greater than the last completed migration."");
```
'''

LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN upgrade FUNCTION
'''
The `upgrade` function allows the owner to upgrade the contract to a new address. However, there is no validation to check if the `new_address` is a valid contract address. If a user mistakenly provides a zero address or a non-contract address, it could lead to issues when trying to call the `setCompleted` function on the upgraded contract.

Recommended Mitigation:
Add a check to ensure that the `new_address` is not a zero address and that it points to a contract. This can be done by checking the code size at the address.

Example of validation:
```solidity
require(new_address != address(0), ""New address cannot be zero address."");
require(isContract(new_address), ""New address must be a contract."");
```
Where `isContract` can be defined as:
```solidity
function isContract(address _addr) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 size;
    assembly {
        size := extcodesize(_addr)
    }
    return size > 0;
}

As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
