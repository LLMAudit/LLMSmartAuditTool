Centralization Risk - Single Address Control
'''
The contract mints tokens directly to specific addresses within the constructor. This means that the control over the initial distribution of tokens is centralized to the deployer's address. If the deployer's address is compromised, an attacker could potentially manipulate the token distribution or create additional tokens without any oversight. 

Recommended Mitigation:
To reduce centralization risk, consider implementing a multi-signature wallet for the minting process or allowing a decentralized governance mechanism where multiple stakeholders can vote on minting decisions. This would distribute control and reduce the risk associated with a single point of failure.
