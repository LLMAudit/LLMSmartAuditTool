Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code for potential improvements and enhancements. 

1. **Upgradeability Considerations**: The contract uses the `Initializable` pattern, which is good for upgradeable contracts. However, we should ensure that the upgradeability mechanism is secure. We could consider implementing a mechanism to restrict who can upgrade the contract, such as a multi-signature wallet.

2. **Access Control**: The contract currently does not specify any access control for pausing and unpausing the contract. Implementing a role-based access control mechanism (like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl`) could enhance security by restricting who can pause or unpause the contract.

3. **Event Emission**: It would be beneficial to emit events when the contract is paused or unpaused. This would provide transparency and allow external observers to track the state of the contract.

4. **Gas Optimization**: The `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function is currently empty. If it is not needed, we could consider removing it to save on gas costs during deployment.

5. **Testing for Edge Cases**: We should ensure that the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function handles edge cases, such as transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens. Adding checks for these conditions could prevent unintended behavior.

6. **Documentation and Comments**: While the contract has some comments, enhancing the documentation to include details about the access control and the implications of pausing the contract could improve maintainability and understanding for future developers.

7. **Fallback Function**: If this contract is intended to receive Ether, we should implement a fallback function to handle incoming Ether transactions appropriately.

What do you think about these suggestions? Are there any specific areas you would like to focus on further?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code for potential improvements and enhancements. 
1. **Upgradeability Considerations**: The contract uses the `Initializable` pattern, which is good for upgradeable contracts. However, we should ensure that the upgradeability mechanism is secure. We could consider implementing a mechanism to restrict who can upgrade the contract, such as a multi-signature wallet.
2. **Access Control**: The contract currently does not specify any access control for pausing and unpausing the contract. Implementing a role-based access control mechanism (like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl`) could enhance security by restricting who can pause or unpause the contract.
3. **Event Emission**: It would be beneficial to emit events when the contract is paused or unpaused. This would provide transparency and allow external observers to track the state of the contract.
4. **Gas Optimization**: The `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function is currently empty. If it is not needed, we could consider removing it to save on gas costs during deployment.
5. **Testing for Edge Cases**: We should ensure that the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function handles edge cases, such as transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens. Adding checks for these conditions could prevent unintended behavior.
6. **Documentation and Comments**: While the contract has some comments, enhancing the documentation to include details about the access control and the implications of pausing the contract could improve maintainability and understanding for future developers.
7. **Fallback Function**: If this contract is intended to receive Ether, we should implement a fallback function to handle incoming Ether transactions appropriately.
What do you think about these suggestions? Are there any specific areas you would like to focus on further? Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"

Security Analyst: I believe all the suggestions are valuable, but let's delve deeper into a couple of them. 

1. **Access Control**: Implementing a role-based access control mechanism is crucial. We could use OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to define roles for pausing and unpausing the contract. This would ensure that only authorized addresses can perform these actions, enhancing security.

2. **Event Emission**: Emitting events for state changes like pausing and unpausing is a great idea. It not only improves transparency but also aids in tracking contract activity on-chain. We could define events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)`.

3. **Gas Optimization**: Regarding the empty `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function, if it serves no purpose, removing it could indeed save gas costs. However, if we plan to extend functionality in the future, we might want to keep it for consistency.

4. **Testing for Edge Cases**: Adding checks for transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens is essential. This would prevent potential issues and ensure that the contract behaves as expected under all circumstances.

5. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing documentation is always beneficial. Clear comments on the purpose of each function and the implications of pausing the contract would aid future developers in understanding the contract's functionality.

Do you have any preferences on which suggestion we should prioritize, or should we aim to implement all of them?

Ideas: " Security Analyst: I believe all the suggestions are valuable, but let's delve deeper into a couple of them. 

1. **Access Control**: Implementing a role-based access control mechanism is crucial. We could use OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to define roles for pausing and unpausing the contract. This would ensure that only authorized addresses can perform these actions, enhancing security.

2. **Event Emission**: Emitting events for state changes like pausing and unpausing is a great idea. It not only improves transparency but also aids in tracking contract activity on-chain. We could define events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)`.

3. **Gas Optimization**: Regarding the empty `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function, if it serves no purpose, removing it could indeed save gas costs. However, if we plan to extend functionality in the future, we might want to keep it for consistency.

4. **Testing for Edge Cases**: Adding checks for transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens is essential. This would prevent potential issues and ensure that the contract behaves as expected under all circumstances.

5. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing documentation is always beneficial. Clear comments on the purpose of each function and the implications of pausing the contract would aid future developers in understanding the contract's functionality.

Do you have any preferences on which suggestion we should prioritize, or should we aim to implement all of them?".
As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,

    ) internal virtual override {

**VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk**
```
While the provided contract does not directly call external contracts, it is important to note that if any functions in the inherited contracts (e.g., ERC20Upgradeable) call external contracts or if the contract is extended in the future to include such functionality, there could be a risk of reentrancy attacks. This could allow an attacker to exploit the contract by repeatedly calling a function before the previous execution is completed.

**Mitigation**: Ensure that any state changes are made before calling external contracts. Additionally, consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to minimize the risk of reentrancy.
```

**VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control for Pausing**
```
The contract allows pausing and unpausing of token transfers, but there is no access control mechanism in place to restrict who can perform these actions. This could lead to unauthorized users pausing the contract, effectively freezing all token transfers.

**Mitigation**: Implement role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` or `Ownable` to restrict the ability to pause and unpause the contract to specific addresses or roles.
```

**VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission for State Changes**
```
The contract does not emit events when the contract is paused or unpaused. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track contract activity and state changes on-chain, which is essential for monitoring and debugging.

**Mitigation**: Add events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)` and emit these events in the functions responsible for pausing and unpausing the contract.
```

**VULNERABILITY: Potential for Unchecked Token Transfers**
```
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function does not check if the `to` address is the zero address or if the `amount` is zero. Transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens can lead to unintended behavior and loss of tokens.

**Mitigation**: Add require statements to check that the `to` address is not the zero address and that the `amount` is greater than zero before proceeding with the transfer.
```

**VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization Opportunity**
```
The empty function `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` serves no purpose and could be removed. While it may be intended for future use, retaining unnecessary functions can lead to increased gas costs during contract deployment.

**Mitigation**: If the function is not needed, it should be removed to optimize gas costs. If future functionality is anticipated, consider documenting the intended use to justify its presence.
```

**VULNERABILITY: Incomplete Documentation**
```
The documentation provided in the contract is minimal and does not cover all aspects of the contract's functionality, especially regarding the implications of pausing the contract. This can lead to misunderstandings by future developers or users of the contract.

**Mitigation**: Enhance the documentation with clear comments on the purpose of each function, the implications of pausing, and any other relevant information that would aid in understanding the contract's functionality.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and considerations:

### Security Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **Reentrancy Risk**: 
   - The contract does not explicitly implement any reentrancy guards. While the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function does not directly call external contracts, any function that transfers tokens could be vulnerable if it interacts with other contracts that may call back into this contract.

2. **Pausable Logic**:
   - The pausable mechanism relies on the correct implementation of the `paused()` function from the `PausableUpgradeable` contract. If there are any flaws in the implementation of this function, it could lead to unintended behavior, allowing transfers when they should be paused.

3. **Initializable Function**:
   - The `__ERC20Pausable_init` function is marked as `internal` and `initializer`, which is correct for upgradeable contracts. However, if the initialization function is not called properly during contract deployment, it could lead to the contract being in an uninitialized state, which may expose vulnerabilities.

4. **Gas Limit and Loops**:
   - The contract does not appear to have any loops, but if future modifications introduce loops (e.g., in minting or burning functions), there could be a risk of exceeding gas limits, leading to failed transactions.

5. **Storage Gaps**:
   - The `uint256[50] private __gap;` is used to reserve space for future upgrades. If not managed properly, it could lead to issues if the storage layout changes in future versions of the contract.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract implements a pausable mechanism for token transfers, minting, and burning, which is a valuable feature for managing token behavior during emergencies or specific evaluation periods. However, several security considerations must be addressed to ensure the contract's robustness:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: It is advisable to implement a reentrancy guard or ensure that any external calls are minimized to prevent potential exploits.
  
- **Pausable Functionality**: The integrity of the pausable functionality must be verified, ensuring that the `paused()` state is correctly managed and cannot be manipulated by unauthorized parties.

- **Initialization Safety**: Care must be taken during the deployment process to ensure that the initializer functions are called appropriately to prevent the contract from being left in an uninitialized state.

- **Future Modifications**: Any future changes to the contract should be carefully reviewed to avoid introducing gas limit issues or storage conflicts.

In conclusion, while the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract provides essential features for managing token transfers, it is crucial to address the identified vulnerabilities and implement best practices for security to safeguard against potential exploits. Regular audits and thorough testing should be conducted, especially after any modifications to the contract.

Ideas: " Security Analyst: I believe all the suggestions are valuable, but let's delve deeper into a couple of them. 

1. **Access Control**: Implementing a role-based access control mechanism is crucial. We could use OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to define roles for pausing and unpausing the contract. This would ensure that only authorized addresses can perform these actions, enhancing security.

2. **Event Emission**: Emitting events for state changes like pausing and unpausing is a great idea. It not only improves transparency but also aids in tracking contract activity on-chain. We could define events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)`.

3. **Gas Optimization**: Regarding the empty `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function, if it serves no purpose, removing it could indeed save gas costs. However, if we plan to extend functionality in the future, we might want to keep it for consistency.

4. **Testing for Edge Cases**: Adding checks for transferring tokens to the zero address or transferring zero tokens is essential. This would prevent potential issues and ensure that the contract behaves as expected under all circumstances.

5. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing documentation is always beneficial. Clear comments on the purpose of each function and the implications of pausing the contract would aid future developers in understanding the contract's functionality.

Do you have any preferences on which suggestion we should prioritize, or should we aim to implement all of them?".
As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

### VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy
```
The contract does not implement any reentrancy guards, which could potentially allow a malicious actor to exploit the contract during token transfers or other state-changing functions. If the contract interacts with other contracts that call back into this contract, it could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

**Mitigation:** Implement a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` or similar pattern to prevent reentrant calls to sensitive functions.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control
```
The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms for pausing and unpausing the contract. This could allow any user to pause the contract, which could lead to denial of service for legitimate users.

**Mitigation:** Implement role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to restrict the ability to pause and unpause the contract to specific addresses or roles.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
The contract does not emit any events when the contract is paused or unpaused. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track state changes and could hinder debugging or monitoring efforts.

**Mitigation:** Define and emit events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)` in the functions that handle pausing and unpausing the contract.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Zero Address Transfer
```
The contract does not check for transfers to the zero address or for transferring zero tokens. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as users losing tokens or being unable to recover them.

**Mitigation:** Add checks in the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function to revert the transaction if `to` is the zero address or if `amount` is zero.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Unused Function
```
The `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function is defined but not utilized. While it does not pose a direct security risk, it adds unnecessary complexity and could lead to confusion for future developers.

**Mitigation:** If the function is not intended for future use, consider removing it to simplify the contract. If it is intended for future extensibility, document its purpose clearly.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Comprehensive Documentation
```
The contract lacks detailed documentation and comments explaining the purpose and implications of each function, especially regarding the pausing mechanism. This could lead to misunderstandings by future developers or auditors.

**Mitigation:** Enhance the documentation by adding clear comments on the purpose of each function, the implications of pausing the contract, and any other relevant information that would aid in understanding the contract's functionality.

Based on the provided smart contract code for `ERC20PausableUpgradeable`, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and considerations:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy Attacks**: 
   - The contract does not implement any specific measures to prevent reentrancy attacks during token transfers. Although the `Pausable` mechanism can halt transfers, if the contract interacts with external contracts, there may still be risks.

2. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms for pausing or unpausing the contract. This could lead to unauthorized users pausing the contract, which would halt all token transfers.

3. **Initialization Issues**:
   - The `__ERC20Pausable_init` function calls `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained`, which is an empty function. If the initialization is not properly handled in derived contracts, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. **Gas Limit and Loops**:
   - The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function does not contain any loops, but if future modifications introduce loops or extensive computations, it could lead to gas limit issues.

5. **Potential Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.6.0 has built-in overflow/underflow checks, it is essential to ensure that any arithmetic operations in future modifications are handled correctly.

6. **Upgradeability Risks**:
   - The use of upgradeable contracts introduces risks related to the upgrade process. If not managed properly, it could lead to vulnerabilities being introduced during upgrades.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract provides a foundational structure for an ERC20 token with the ability to pause transfers, which is beneficial for emergency situations. However, several security vulnerabilities and considerations must be addressed to ensure the contract's robustness:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Implement checks or use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to mitigate reentrancy risks, especially when interacting with external contracts.
  
- **Access Control**: Introduce role-based access control mechanisms (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl`) to restrict who can pause or unpause the contract.

- **Initialization Safety**: Ensure that all initialization functions are properly defined and called in derived contracts to prevent uninitialized states.

- **Gas Optimization**: Monitor for potential gas limit issues in future modifications, especially if loops or complex logic are introduced.

- **Arithmetic Safety**: Although Solidity 0.6.0 provides built-in checks, always validate arithmetic operations in custom logic to prevent unexpected behavior.

- **Upgradeability Management**: Establish a clear upgrade process and auditing mechanism to ensure that upgrades do not introduce new vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, while the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract provides essential functionalities, it is crucial to address the identified vulnerabilities and implement best practices in smart contract development to enhance security and reliability. Regular audits and updates should be part of the development lifecycle to adapt to evolving security standards.

VULNERABILITY: Reentrancy Risk
```
Although the provided contract does not directly involve external calls that could lead to reentrancy, it is essential to be cautious when implementing functions that may later include external interactions (e.g., minting or burning tokens). If these functions are added in the future, they could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. To mitigate this risk, ensure that any state changes occur before external calls, and consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control
```
The contract does not implement any access control mechanism for pausing and unpausing the contract. This could allow any user to pause the contract, potentially leading to denial of service for all users. To mitigate this, implement role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` or `Ownable` pattern to restrict pausing and unpausing functions to authorized addresses only.
```

VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
The contract does not emit any events when the contract is paused or unpaused. This lack of transparency can hinder tracking and auditing of contract activity. To improve this, define and emit events such as `Paused(address account)` and `Unpaused(address account)` within the functions that handle pausing and unpausing the contract.
```

VULNERABILITY: Potential for Zero Address Transfers
```
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function does not check if the `to` address is the zero address. Transferring tokens to the zero address can lead to token loss, as those tokens would be irretrievable. To mitigate this, add a require statement to check that the `to` address is not the zero address:
require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
```

VULNERABILITY: Zero Token Transfer
```
The contract does not check if the `amount` being transferred is greater than zero. Allowing zero token transfers can lead to unnecessary state changes and may confuse users. To mitigate this, add a require statement to ensure that the `amount` is greater than zero:
require(amount > 0, "ERC20: transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

VULNERABILITY: Unused Function
```
The `__ERC20Pausable_init_unchained` function is defined but does not contain any logic. While it does not pose a direct vulnerability, it may lead to confusion for future developers. If there are no plans to extend functionality in this function, consider removing it to reduce gas costs and improve code clarity. If it is retained for future use, ensure to document its intended purpose.
```

VULNERABILITY: Insufficient Documentation
```
While the contract has some comments, the documentation could be improved to provide clearer guidance on the purpose and implications of each function, especially regarding the pausing mechanism. This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstandings or misuse of the contract. To mitigate this, enhance the documentation with detailed comments explaining the functionality, expected behavior, and any important considerations for future developers.

This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstandings or misuse of the contract. To mitigate this, enhance the documentation with detailed comments explaining the functionality, expected behavior, and any important considerations for future developers.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and considerations:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**:
   - The contract does not explicitly implement any reentrancy guards. While the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function does not directly transfer Ether or call external contracts, it is important to ensure that any future extensions or implementations do not introduce reentrancy risks.

2. **Pausable Functionality**:
   - The contract relies on the `paused` state to control token transfers. If the pause functionality is not managed properly (e.g., if the owner account is compromised), it could lead to a situation where all token transfers are halted indefinitely.

3. **Initialization Issues**:
   - The contract uses an initializer function (`__ERC20Pausable_init`) to set up the contract. If this function is not called correctly during deployment, it could lead to uninitialized state variables or improper contract behavior. It is crucial to ensure that the initializer is called exactly once.

4. **Upgradeability Risks**:
   - The contract inherits from `Initializable`, which is part of an upgradeable pattern. If the upgrade mechanism is not properly secured, it could allow malicious actors to replace the contract logic with harmful code.

5. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms for functions that might require restricted access (e.g., pausing/unpausing the contract). This could lead to unauthorized users being able to pause or unpause token transfers.

6. **Gas Limit and Loops**:
   - Although not directly visible in the provided code, any future implementation that involves loops (e.g., batch transfers) could run into gas limit issues. It is important to consider the implications of gas limits in the design of the contract.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract is designed to provide a pausable ERC20 token functionality, which is beneficial for scenarios requiring control over token transfers. However, several security vulnerabilities and considerations must be addressed to ensure the contract's robustness:

- **Reentrancy**: While the current implementation does not expose direct reentrancy risks, developers should remain vigilant about future modifications that may introduce such vulnerabilities.
  
- **Pausable Mechanism**: The reliance on a pause mechanism necessitates careful management of access controls to prevent misuse. It is recommended to implement role-based access control to restrict who can pause or unpause the contract.

- **Initialization Safety**: The initializer pattern must be followed meticulously to avoid uninitialized states. Developers should ensure that the initializer is invoked correctly during deployment.

- **Upgradeability Concerns**: The upgradeable nature of the contract introduces risks if not managed properly. It is essential to implement secure upgrade mechanisms and to audit any changes thoroughly.

- **Access Control**: Implementing access control for critical functions is paramount to prevent unauthorized actions that could compromise the contract's integrity.

- **Gas Limit Considerations**: Future implementations should be designed with gas efficiency in mind, particularly when dealing with batch operations.

In conclusion, while the `ERC20PausableUpgradeable` contract provides valuable functionality, it is crucial to address the identified vulnerabilities and implement best practices in security and access control to ensure the contract operates safely and effectively in a production environment. Regular audits and updates should be part of the contract's lifecycle to adapt to evolving security standards and practices.

Based on the existing test report stating that the software ran successfully without errors, it appears that there are no immediate issues or bugs identified during the initial testing phase. However, a thorough security audit and code review are essential to ensure the robustness and security of the smart contract.

To provide a comprehensive overview, here is a summary of potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern in the ERC20PausableUpgradeable contract:

1. Lack of Access Control: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can pause and unpause the contract. This could potentially lead to unauthorized parties manipulating the contract's state.

2. External Dependency Risks: The contract imports external contracts such as ERC20Upgradeable, PausableUpgradeable, and Initializable. Any vulnerabilities or issues in these dependencies could impact the security of the ERC20PausableUpgradeable contract.

3. Limited Testing Scope: The existing test report only mentions that the software ran without errors, indicating a lack of detailed testing scenarios, including security testing and edge cases.

Comprehensive Test Report Summary:
- The initial test report indicates that the software ran successfully without errors.
- However, the absence of detailed security testing and edge case scenarios raises concerns about the contract's resilience to potential vulnerabilities.
- Further testing is recommended to assess the contract's behavior under various attack scenarios, including reentrancy, overflow, underflow, and other common vulnerabilities.
- A thorough code review and security audit are essential to identify and address any potential bugs or security risks in the smart contract.

In conclusion, while the initial test report suggests no immediate issues, a more in-depth security assessment is crucial to ensure the solidity and reliability of the ERC20PausableUpgradeable contract.
