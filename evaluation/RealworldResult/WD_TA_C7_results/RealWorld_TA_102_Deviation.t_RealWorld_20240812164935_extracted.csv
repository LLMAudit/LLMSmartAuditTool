,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Precision Loss Identified.

**Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**
'''
In the `testDeviation` function, the calculation of `basisPoints` involves integer division, specifically in the line:
```solidity
uint256 basisPoints = (absDeviation * Constants.BASIS_POINTS_GRANULARITY) / x.toUint256();
```
If `x` is significantly larger than `absDeviation`, the result of the division may truncate the decimal portion, leading to a loss of precision. This can result in incorrect calculations of deviation thresholds, especially when `x` is small or when `absDeviation` is a small fraction of `x`.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a higher precision type for the calculations, such as fixed-point arithmetic libraries, or ensure that the division is performed in a way that maintains precision. For example, you could rearrange the calculation to multiply before dividing:
```solidity
uint256 basisPoints = (absDeviation * Constants.BASIS_POINTS_GRANULARITY * 1e18) / x.toUint256();
```
This approach scales the calculation to avoid precision loss during division.

Ideas: "" Precision Loss Identified.

**Precision Loss in Arithmetic Operations**
'''
In the `testDeviation` function, the calculation of `basisPoints` involves integer division, specifically in the line:
```solidity
uint256 basisPoints = (absDeviation * Constants.BASIS_POINTS_GRANULARITY) / x.toUint256();
```
If `x` is significantly larger than `absDeviation`, the result of the division may truncate the decimal portion, leading to a loss of precision. This can result in incorrect calculations of deviation thresholds, especially when `x` is small or when `absDeviation` is a small fraction of `x`.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
To mitigate this issue, consider using a higher precision type for the calculations, such as fixed-point arithmetic libraries, or ensure that the division is performed in a way that maintains precision. For example, you could rearrange the calculation to multiply before dividing:
```solidity
uint256 basisPoints = (absDeviation * Constants.BASIS_POINTS_GRANULARITY * 1e18) / x.toUint256();
```
This approach scales the calculation to avoid precision loss during division.

As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Redundant Conditional Checks. There are specific cases where the code may have Redundant Conditional Check vulnerabilities:
1. Conditional checks that always evaluate to true or false, which add unnecessary complexity and gas costs to the code.
2. Conditions that duplicate checks already performed earlier in the code, leading to redundant operations and inefficient execution.
If you identify any redundant conditional checks, respond with: """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
