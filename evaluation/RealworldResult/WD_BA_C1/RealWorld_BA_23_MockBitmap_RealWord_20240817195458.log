Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code and brainstorm potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Input Validation**: The current functions do not validate the `index` parameter in `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `totalBitsSet`. Adding checks to ensure that the index is within a valid range (0 to 255 for a `bytes32` type) would prevent out-of-bounds errors.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The contract could be optimized for gas usage. For instance, if the `setBit` function is called frequently, we could consider caching the bitmap state or using a more gas-efficient data structure.

3. **Event Logging**: Implementing events for actions like setting a bit could provide better transparency and traceability. For example, emitting an event in the `setBit` function would allow external observers to track changes to the bitmap.

4. **Access Control**: If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, we might want to implement access control mechanisms (like OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles) to restrict who can call certain functions.

5. **Testing and Documentation**: Ensure that there are comprehensive tests for all functions, especially edge cases. Additionally, providing clear documentation for each function would help users understand how to interact with the contract.

6. **Upgradeability**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state.

7. **Error Handling**: Instead of relying solely on `require` statements, we could implement more descriptive error messages to help users understand what went wrong.

Which of these suggestions resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code and brainstorm potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Input Validation**: The current functions do not validate the `index` parameter in `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `totalBitsSet`. Adding checks to ensure that the index is within a valid range (0 to 255 for a `bytes32` type) would prevent out-of-bounds errors.
2. **Gas Optimization**: The contract could be optimized for gas usage. For instance, if the `setBit` function is called frequently, we could consider caching the bitmap state or using a more gas-efficient data structure.
3. **Event Logging**: Implementing events for actions like setting a bit could provide better transparency and traceability. For example, emitting an event in the `setBit` function would allow external observers to track changes to the bitmap.
4. **Access Control**: If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, we might want to implement access control mechanisms (like OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles) to restrict who can call certain functions.
5. **Testing and Documentation**: Ensure that there are comprehensive tests for all functions, especially edge cases. Additionally, providing clear documentation for each function would help users understand how to interact with the contract.
6. **Upgradeability**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state.
7. **Error Handling**: Instead of relying solely on `require` statements, we could implement more descriptive error messages to help users understand what went wrong.
Which of these suggestions resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind? Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"

VULNERABILITY: Input Validation
```
The current functions `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `totalBitsSet` do not validate the `index` parameter. Since `bytes32` can only represent bits in the range of 0 to 255, passing an index outside this range could lead to unexpected behavior or out-of-bounds errors. This could potentially allow a user to manipulate the bitmap in unintended ways.

**Mitigation**: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the `index` is within the valid range. For example, in the `setBit` function, you could add:
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds");
```

VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
The contract does not currently optimize for gas usage, especially in the `setBit` function, which could be called frequently. If the bitmap state is not cached, it may lead to higher gas costs.

**Mitigation**: Consider caching the bitmap state or using a more gas-efficient data structure. This could involve storing the bitmap in a state variable rather than passing it as a parameter, depending on the intended use case.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Event Logging
```
The contract does not emit any events for state-changing operations, such as setting a bit. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track changes to the bitmap and could hinder debugging efforts.

**Mitigation**: Implement event logging in the `setBit` function. For example:
event BitSet(bytes32 indexed bitmap, uint256 indexed index, bool setOn);
Emit this event whenever a bit is set to provide better traceability.
```

VULNERABILITY: Access Control
```
The contract currently does not implement any access control mechanisms. If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, it could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, allowing anyone to modify the bitmap.

**Mitigation**: Implement access control mechanisms, such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles, to restrict who can call certain functions. For example, you could restrict the `setBit` function to only be callable by the contract owner.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Error Handling
```
The contract relies solely on `require` statements without providing descriptive error messages. This can make it difficult for users to understand what went wrong when a transaction fails.

**Mitigation**: Implement more descriptive error messages in the `require` statements to help users understand the context of the failure. For example:
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds: must be between 0 and 255");
```

VULNERABILITY: Testing and Documentation
```
The contract does not mention any testing or documentation practices. Without comprehensive tests, especially for edge cases, there is a risk of undiscovered bugs that could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**: Ensure that there are comprehensive tests for all functions, especially edge cases. Additionally, provide clear documentation for each function to help users understand how to interact with the contract.
```

VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability
```
The contract does not consider upgradeability, which could be an issue if future improvements or bug fixes are needed. Without a mechanism for upgrades, the contract may become obsolete or require a complete redeployment.

**Mitigation**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state.

The contract does not emit any events for state-changing operations, such as setting a bit. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track changes to the bitmap and could hinder debugging efforts.

**Mitigation**: Implement event logging in the `setBit` function. For example:
event BitSet(bytes32 indexed bitmap, uint256 indexed index, bool setOn);
Emit this event whenever a bit is set to provide better traceability.
```

VULNERABILITY: Access Control
```
The contract currently does not implement any access control mechanisms. If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, it could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, allowing anyone to modify the bitmap.

**Mitigation**: Implement access control mechanisms, such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles, to restrict who can call certain functions. For example, you could restrict the `setBit` function to only be callable by the contract owner.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Error Handling
```
The contract relies solely on `require` statements without providing descriptive error messages. This can make it difficult for users to understand what went wrong when a transaction fails.

**Mitigation**: Implement more descriptive error messages in the `require` statements to help users understand the context of the failure. For example:
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds: must be between 0 and 255");
```

VULNERABILITY: Testing and Documentation
```
The contract does not mention any testing or documentation practices. Without comprehensive tests, especially for edge cases, there is a risk of undiscovered bugs that could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**: Ensure that there are comprehensive tests for all functions, especially edge cases. Additionally, provide clear documentation for each function to help users understand how to interact with the contract.
```

VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability
```
The contract does not consider upgradeability, which could be an issue if future improvements or bug fixes are needed. Without a mechanism for upgrades, the contract may become obsolete or require a complete redeployment.

**Mitigation**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state.

Based on the provided smart contract code for `MockBitmap`, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and concerns identified within the contract:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The functions in the `MockBitmap` contract are public and can be called by any user. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the bitmap data. It is advisable to implement access control mechanisms (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl) to restrict function calls to authorized users only.

2. **No Input Validation**:
   - The contract does not validate the `index` parameter in the `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `getNextBitNum` functions. If an invalid index is provided (e.g., a negative number or an excessively large number), it could lead to unexpected behavior or gas inefficiencies. Input validation should be added to ensure that the index is within a valid range.

3. **Potential for Gas Limit Issues**:
   - The `setBit` function could potentially lead to gas limit issues if the bitmap is manipulated in a way that requires extensive computation. Although this is not a direct vulnerability, it could affect the usability of the contract under certain conditions.

4. **Use of Experimental Features**:
   - The contract uses `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`, which indicates that it relies on experimental features of the Solidity compiler. While this may be necessary for certain functionalities, it can introduce instability or unexpected behavior. It is advisable to ensure that the contract is compatible with stable features of Solidity.

5. **Bitmap Library Dependency**:
   - The contract relies on an external library (`Bitmap.sol`) for its core functionalities. If this library contains vulnerabilities or bugs, they could propagate to the `MockBitmap` contract. It is essential to review the library code for security issues and ensure it is well-audited.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `MockBitmap` contract serves as a utility for manipulating and querying bitmap data. While the contract implements basic functionalities effectively, several security vulnerabilities and concerns need to be addressed to enhance its robustness and security:

- **Access Control**: Implementing access control mechanisms is crucial to prevent unauthorized users from manipulating the bitmap data. This can be achieved by restricting access to certain functions based on user roles.

- **Input Validation**: Adding input validation checks for the `index` parameter will help prevent unexpected behavior and ensure that the contract operates within defined parameters.

- **Gas Limit Considerations**: While not a direct vulnerability, developers should be aware of potential gas limit issues when manipulating large bitmaps. Optimizing the contract for gas efficiency can improve user experience.

- **Experimental Features**: The use of experimental features should be approached with caution. It is advisable to monitor updates from the Solidity team and migrate to stable features when possible.

- **Library Review**: A thorough review of the `Bitmap` library is essential to ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities into the `MockBitmap` contract.

In conclusion, while the `MockBitmap` contract provides useful functionalities, addressing the identified vulnerabilities will significantly enhance its security and reliability. A thorough audit of both the contract and its dependencies is recommended before deployment to ensure a secure and efficient implementation.

3. **Event Logging**: Implementing events for actions like setting a bit could provide better transparency and traceability. For example, emitting an event in the `setBit` function would allow external observers to track changes to the bitmap.

4. **Access Control**: If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, we might want to implement access control mechanisms (like OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles) to restrict who can call certain functions.

5. **Testing and Documentation**: Ensure that there are comprehensive tests for all functions, especially edge cases. Additionally, providing clear documentation for each function would help users understand how to interact with the contract.

6. **Upgradeability**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state.

7. **Error Handling**: Instead of relying solely on `require` statements, we could implement more descriptive error messages to help users understand what went wrong.

Which of these suggestions resonates with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?".
As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

Here is a new customer's task: // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity >0.7.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "../math/Bitmap.sol";

contract MockBitmap {
    using Bitmap for bytes32;

    function isBitSet(bytes32 bitmap, uint256 index) public pure returns (bool) {
        return bitmap.isBitSet(index);
    }

    function setBit(
        bytes32 bitmap,
        uint256 index,
        bool setOn
    ) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        return bitmap.setBit(index, setOn);
    }

    function totalBitsSet(bytes32 bitmap) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return bitmap.totalBitsSet();
    }

    function getMSB(uint256 x) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return Bitmap.getMSB(x);
    }

    function getNextBitNum(bytes32 x) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return Bitmap.getNextBitNum(x);
    }
}
.]

### VULNERABILITY: Input Validation
```
The current functions `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `totalBitsSet` do not validate the `index` parameter. Since `bytes32` can represent a bitmap of 256 bits, the valid range for `index` is 0 to 255. If an out-of-bounds index is provided, it could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results. 

**Impact**: This could potentially allow users to manipulate the bitmap in unintended ways, leading to logical errors in the application using this contract.

**Mitigation**: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the `index` is within the valid range. For example, in the `setBit` function, you could add:
```solidity
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds");
```
This check should be added to all relevant functions.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Event Logging
```
The contract does not emit any events when bits are set or modified. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for external observers to track changes to the bitmap.

**Impact**: Without event logging, it becomes challenging to audit the contract's state changes, which can hinder debugging and monitoring efforts.

**Mitigation**: Implement event logging in the `setBit` function. For example:
```solidity
event BitSet(bytes32 indexed bitmap, uint256 indexed index, bool setOn);

function setBit(
    bytes32 bitmap,
    uint256 index,
    bool setOn
) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    emit BitSet(bitmap, index, setOn);
    return bitmap.setBit(index, setOn);
}
```
This will allow external observers to track when bits are set.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
The contract may incur high gas costs if the `setBit` function is called frequently. Each call creates a new `bytes32` state, which can be inefficient.

**Impact**: High gas costs can deter users from interacting with the contract, especially if they need to set multiple bits in succession.

**Mitigation**: Consider caching the bitmap state or using a more gas-efficient data structure, such as a mapping or an array, depending on the use case. This would reduce the overhead of creating new `bytes32` instances on each call.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control
```
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, meaning that any user can call the functions, including potentially malicious actors.

**Impact**: This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the bitmap, which could compromise the integrity of the data.

**Mitigation**: Implement access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles. For example, you could restrict the `setBit` function to only be callable by the contract owner:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MockBitmap is Ownable {
    // existing functions...

    function setBit(
        bytes32 bitmap,
        uint256 index,
        bool setOn
    ) public onlyOwner pure returns (bytes32) {
        return bitmap.setBit(index, setOn);
    }
}
```
This ensures that only the owner can modify the bitmap.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Testing and Documentation
```
The contract lacks comprehensive tests and documentation for its functions. This can lead to misunderstandings about how to use the contract and potential misuse.

**Impact**: Without proper tests, edge cases may not be handled correctly, leading to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

**Mitigation**: Develop a suite of unit tests that cover all functions, including edge cases. Additionally, provide clear documentation for each function, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability
```
The contract does not consider upgradeability, meaning that if a bug is found or new features are needed, the contract cannot be easily upgraded without losing its state.

**Impact**: This can lead to significant challenges in maintaining the contract over time, especially in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.

**Mitigation**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This allows the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing its state. Libraries like OpenZeppelin provide tools for implementing upgradeable contracts.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Error Handling
```
The contract relies solely on `require` statements without providing descriptive error messages for all potential failure points.

**Impact**: This can make it difficult for users to understand what went wrong when a function call fails, leading to a poor user experience.

**Mitigation**: Implement more descriptive error messages in `require` statements to provide clarity on the nature of the error. For example:
```solidity
require(index < 256, "Index must be between 0 and 255");
```
This will help users understand the constraints of the function.

Based on the provided smart contract code for `MockBitmap`, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and issues identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The functions in the `MockBitmap` contract are public and can be called by any user. This could lead to unauthorized manipulation of the bitmap data, especially if the contract is intended to be used in a context where only certain users should have the ability to modify the bitmap.

2. **Data Integrity Risks**:
   - Since the contract allows any user to set bits in the bitmap, there is a risk of data integrity issues. Malicious users could set bits in a way that disrupts the intended functionality of the contract.

3. **Gas Limit and Block Size**:
   - The functions that manipulate the bitmap may lead to high gas consumption if the bitmap is large or if many bits are being set or checked. This could lead to transactions failing due to exceeding gas limits.

4. **Potential for Integer Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.0 and above has built-in overflow and underflow checks, if the contract were to be deployed on an older version, there could be vulnerabilities related to integer operations, especially when manipulating indices.

5. **No Event Logging**:
   - The contract does not emit any events when bits are set or checked. This lack of logging can make it difficult to track changes and audit the state of the bitmap, which is crucial for transparency and debugging.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `MockBitmap` contract provides basic functionality for manipulating a bitmap using a series of public functions. However, it lacks essential security measures that could protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. The absence of access control mechanisms allows any user to modify the bitmap, which could lead to unintended consequences or exploitation by malicious actors.

Additionally, the contract does not implement event logging, which is vital for tracking state changes and ensuring transparency. This oversight can hinder the ability to audit the contract's operations effectively.

To enhance the security and reliability of the `MockBitmap` contract, it is recommended to implement the following measures:

- **Access Control**: Introduce role-based access control to restrict who can call the functions that modify the bitmap.
- **Event Emission**: Emit events for critical state changes to facilitate tracking and auditing.
- **Gas Optimization**: Consider the gas implications of bitmap operations and optimize for efficiency.
- **Versioning**: Ensure the contract is deployed with a Solidity version that includes overflow/underflow protections.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the contract can be made more secure and robust, ultimately leading to a safer deployment in a production environment.

import "../math/Bitmap.sol";

contract MockBitmap {
    using Bitmap for bytes32;

    function isBitSet(bytes32 bitmap, uint256 index) public pure returns (bool) {
        return bitmap.isBitSet(index);
    }

}
.]

VULNERABILITY: Input Validation
```
The current functions `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `totalBitsSet` do not validate the `index` parameter. Since `bytes32` can only represent bits from 0 to 255, passing an out-of-bounds index could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the bitmap in unintended ways.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement input validation checks to ensure that the `index` is within the valid range (0 to 255). For example, in the `setBit` function, you could add:
```solidity
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds");
```
This should be added to all relevant functions.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Event Logging
```
The contract does not emit any events when bits are set or modified. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to track changes to the bitmap, which is especially important in a decentralized environment where actions should be verifiable.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement event logging in the `setBit` function. For example:
```solidity
event BitSet(bytes32 indexed bitmap, uint256 indexed index, bool setOn);

function setBit(
    bytes32 bitmap,
    uint256 index,
    bool setOn
) public pure returns (bytes32) {
    emit BitSet(bitmap, index, setOn);
    return bitmap.setBit(index, setOn);
}
```
This will allow external observers to track changes to the bitmap.
```

VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
The contract may incur high gas costs if the `setBit` function is called frequently, especially if it modifies the bitmap state repeatedly. This could lead to inefficient transactions and higher costs for users.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider caching the bitmap state or using a more gas-efficient data structure. For example, if the bitmap is frequently modified, storing it in a state variable instead of passing it as a parameter could reduce gas costs. However, this would require careful management of state and access control.
```

VULNERABILITY: Access Control
```
The contract currently does not implement any access control mechanisms. If this contract is intended to be used in a broader application, it is crucial to restrict who can call certain functions, particularly `setBit`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or Roles. For example, you could modify the `setBit` function to only allow the contract owner to modify the bitmap:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MockBitmap is Ownable {
    ...
    function setBit(
        bytes32 bitmap,
        uint256 index,
        bool setOn
    ) public onlyOwner pure returns (bytes32) {
        return bitmap.setBit(index, setOn);
    }
}
```
This ensures that only authorized users can modify the bitmap.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Error Handling
```
The contract relies solely on `require` statements without providing descriptive error messages. This can make it difficult for users to understand what went wrong if a transaction fails.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement more descriptive error messages in `require` statements. For example, in the `setBit` function:
```solidity
require(index < 256, "Index out of bounds: must be between 0 and 255");
```
This will provide clearer feedback to users when errors occur.
```

VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability
```
The contract does not currently support upgradeability. If there are bugs or if new features need to be added in the future, the contract would need to be redeployed, which could lead to loss of state or require users to migrate.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This allows the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing the state. OpenZeppelin provides a library for implementing upgradeable contracts that can be leveraged.

}
.]

Based on the provided smart contract code for `MockBitmap`, I will analyze the potential security vulnerabilities and summarize the findings.

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The functions in the `MockBitmap` contract are all public and can be called by any user. This could lead to unintended usage or manipulation of the bitmap data, especially if the contract is intended to be used in a more restricted manner.

2. **No Input Validation**:
   - The functions do not validate the `index` parameter in `isBitSet`, `setBit`, and `getNextBitNum`. If the index is out of bounds (greater than 255 for a `bytes32` bitmap), it could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

3. **Potential Gas Limit Issues**:
   - The `totalBitsSet` function could potentially consume a significant amount of gas if the bitmap is large and densely populated. While `bytes32` is limited to 256 bits, if the contract were to be modified to handle larger bitmaps, this could become a concern.

4. **Use of Experimental Features**:
   - The contract uses `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`, which indicates that it relies on experimental features of the Solidity compiler. These features may not be fully tested and could introduce unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

5. **No Events Emitted**:
   - The contract does not emit any events for state changes (e.g., when a bit is set or checked). This lack of logging can make it difficult to track changes and debug issues in the contract.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `MockBitmap` contract is a straightforward implementation that provides functionality for manipulating a bitmap represented as a `bytes32` value. However, several security vulnerabilities and design considerations need to be addressed:

- **Access Control**: The absence of access control mechanisms allows any user to interact with the contract's functions. Implementing role-based access control or ownership checks would enhance security.

- **Input Validation**: Functions should include checks to ensure that the `index` parameter is within valid bounds. This will prevent potential out-of-bounds errors and ensure the integrity of the bitmap operations.

- **Gas Consumption**: While the current implementation is limited to a `bytes32` bitmap, future modifications should consider gas efficiency, especially if the bitmap size increases.

- **Experimental Features**: The reliance on experimental features could lead to instability. It is advisable to monitor updates from the Solidity team and transition to stable features when possible.

- **Event Logging**: Implementing event logging for significant actions within the contract will improve transparency and facilitate easier debugging and monitoring of contract activity.

### Recommendations:

1. Introduce access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized users.
2. Implement input validation for all parameters to ensure they are within expected ranges.
3. Consider the gas implications of future modifications and optimize functions accordingly.
4. Transition away from experimental features as they become stable.
5. Add event emissions for key actions to improve traceability and monitoring.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended changes, the `MockBitmap` contract can be made more secure and robust for deployment in a production environment.
