[We are a specialized team that audits Solidity smart contracts using an advanced multi-agent system. Our approach combines the expertise of project management, smart contract counseling, auditing, and Solidity programming to deliver comprehensive and reliable contract assessments.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully analyze a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
// a library for handling binary fixed point numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format))

// range: [0, 2**112 - 1]
// resolution: 1 / 2**112

library UQ112x112 {
    uint224 constant Q112 = 2**112;

    // encode a uint112 as a UQ112x112
    function encode(uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
        z = uint224(y) * Q112; // never overflows
    }

    // divide a UQ112x112 by a uint112, returning a UQ112x112

        z = x / uint224(y);
    }
}
.]

Let's analyze the provided contract code and identify potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Error Handling in Division**: The `uqdiv` function currently does not handle the case where `y` is zero. Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error. We should add a require statement to check for this condition.

2. **Documentation and Comments**: While the library has a brief description, adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.

3. **Testing for Edge Cases**: We should consider implementing unit tests to cover edge cases, such as the maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`, and ensure that the functions behave as expected.

4. **Gas Optimization**: Although the current implementation is straightforward, we could explore whether there are more gas-efficient ways to perform the operations, especially if this library is intended to be used frequently.

5. **Versioning**: The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). It might be beneficial to allow for a range of versions to ensure compatibility with future updates, unless there are specific reasons to lock it to this version.

6. **Additional Mathematical Functions**: Depending on the use case, it might be useful to add more mathematical operations (like multiplication or subtraction) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality.

7. **Security Audits**: Regular audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in critical financial applications, should be emphasized to ensure ongoing security.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional thoughts or ideas?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided contract code and identify potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Error Handling in Division**: The `uqdiv` function currently does not handle the case where `y` is zero. Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error. We should add a require statement to check for this condition.
2. **Documentation and Comments**: While the library has a brief description, adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.
3. **Testing for Edge Cases**: We should consider implementing unit tests to cover edge cases, such as the maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`, and ensure that the functions behave as expected.
4. **Gas Optimization**: Although the current implementation is straightforward, we could explore whether there are more gas-efficient ways to perform the operations, especially if this library is intended to be used frequently.
5. **Versioning**: The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). It might be beneficial to allow for a range of versions to ensure compatibility with future updates, unless there are specific reasons to lock it to this version.
6. **Additional Mathematical Functions**: Depending on the use case, it might be useful to add more mathematical operations (like multiplication or subtraction) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality.
7. **Security Audits**: Regular audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in critical financial applications, should be emphasized to ensure ongoing security.
Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional thoughts or ideas? Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"

### VULNERABILITY: Division by Zero
```
The `uqdiv` function does not handle the case where the divisor `y` is zero. Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error, which can lead to unexpected behavior or contract failure. This is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited if the function is called with a zero value for `y`.

**Impact**: If `uqdiv` is called with `y` as zero, it will revert the transaction, which can be detrimental in scenarios where this function is part of a larger transaction flow.

**Mitigation**: Add a require statement at the beginning of the `uqdiv` function to check that `y` is not zero.

```solidity
function uqdiv(uint224 x, uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
    require(y != 0, "Division by zero");
    z = x / uint224(y);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Detailed Documentation
```
While the library has a brief description, the functions lack detailed comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This can lead to misunderstandings or misuse of the library by other developers.

**Impact**: Poor documentation can result in incorrect usage of the library, leading to potential bugs or vulnerabilities in contracts that depend on it.

**Mitigation**: Enhance the documentation by adding detailed comments for each function, explaining the parameters, return values, and any important notes regarding usage.

```solidity
/// @notice Encodes a uint112 as a UQ112x112 fixed point number.
/// @param y The uint112 value to encode.
/// @return z The encoded UQ112x112 value.
function encode(uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
    z = uint224(y) * Q112; // never overflows
}

/// @notice Divides a UQ112x112 by a uint112, returning a UQ112x112.
/// @param x The UQ112x112 value to divide.
/// @param y The uint112 divisor.
/// @return z The result of the division as a UQ112x112 value.
function uqdiv(uint224 x, uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
    require(y != 0, "Division by zero");
    z = x / uint224(y);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Unit Tests
```
The library does not include any unit tests to verify the correctness of its functions, especially for edge cases such as maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`.

**Impact**: Without unit tests, there is no assurance that the functions behave as expected under all conditions, which could lead to undetected bugs.

**Mitigation**: Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover normal cases, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios for both `encode` and `uqdiv` functions.

```solidity
// Example of a unit test for uqdiv
function testUQDiv() public {
    uint224 result = UQ112x112.uqdiv(2**224 - 1, 1);
    assert(result == 2**224 - 1);
    
    // Test division by zero
    try UQ112x112.uqdiv(1, 0) {
        assert(false); // should not reach here
    } catch {}
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Fixed Solidity Version
```
The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). This can lead to compatibility issues with future versions of Solidity that may include important updates or optimizations.

**Impact**: Locking the contract to a specific version may prevent it from benefiting from improvements or security patches in newer versions.

**Mitigation**: Change the pragma directive to allow a range of versions, ensuring compatibility with future updates.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; // Allows for any version from 0.8.0 to below 0.9.0
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Limited Mathematical Operations
```
The library currently only provides encoding and division functions. Depending on the use case, this may limit its usability in more complex scenarios that require additional mathematical operations.

**Impact**: Users may need to implement their own mathematical functions, which could lead to inconsistencies or errors.

**Mitigation**: Consider adding more mathematical operations (such as multiplication, subtraction, and addition) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality.

```solidity
// Example of a multiplication function
function uqmul(uint224 x, uint224 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
    z = (x * y) / Q112; // Implementing multiplication with fixed point adjustment
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Security Audits
```
The library does not mention any regular security audits or reviews. Given that it may be used in critical financial applications, this is a significant oversight.

**Impact**: Without regular audits, vulnerabilities may go undetected, leading to potential exploits or financial losses.

**Mitigation**: Establish a routine for regular security audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in high-stakes environments.

    z = x / uint224(y);
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Unit Tests
```
The library does not include any unit tests to verify the correctness of its functions, especially for edge cases such as maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`.

**Impact**: Without unit tests, there is no assurance that the functions behave as expected under all conditions, which could lead to undetected bugs.

**Mitigation**: Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover normal cases, edge cases, and potential failure scenarios for both `encode` and `uqdiv` functions.

```solidity
// Example of a unit test for uqdiv
function testUQDiv() public {
    uint224 result = UQ112x112.uqdiv(2**224 - 1, 1);
    assert(result == 2**224 - 1);
    
    // Test division by zero
    try UQ112x112.uqdiv(1, 0) {
        assert(false); // should not reach here
    } catch {}
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Fixed Solidity Version
```
The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). This can lead to compatibility issues with future versions of Solidity that may include important updates or optimizations.

**Impact**: Locking the contract to a specific version may prevent it from benefiting from improvements or security patches in newer versions.

**Mitigation**: Change the pragma directive to allow a range of versions, ensuring compatibility with future updates.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; // Allows for any version from 0.8.0 to below 0.9.0
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Limited Mathematical Operations
```
The library currently only provides encoding and division functions. Depending on the use case, this may limit its usability in more complex scenarios that require additional mathematical operations.

**Impact**: Users may need to implement their own mathematical functions, which could lead to inconsistencies or errors.

**Mitigation**: Consider adding more mathematical operations (such as multiplication, subtraction, and addition) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality.

```solidity
// Example of a multiplication function
function uqmul(uint224 x, uint224 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
    z = (x * y) / Q112; // Implementing multiplication with fixed point adjustment
}
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Security Audits
```
The library does not mention any regular security audits or reviews. Given that it may be used in critical financial applications, this is a significant oversight.

**Impact**: Without regular audits, vulnerabilities may go undetected, leading to potential exploits or financial losses.

**Mitigation**: Establish a routine for regular security audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in high-stakes environments.

Based on the provided Solidity code for the UQ112x112 library, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and issues identified:

### Security Vulnerabilities Summary:

1. **Division by Zero**: 
   - In the `uqdiv` function, if the parameter `y` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. This can cause the transaction to revert, which is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Lack of Input Validation**:
   - The functions do not validate the input parameters. For example, there is no check to ensure that the input `y` in the `uqdiv` function is greater than zero before performing the division. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

3. **Potential Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.x has built-in overflow and underflow checks, it is still important to ensure that the operations performed (especially in the `encode` function) do not exceed the limits of the data types used. The multiplication of `uint224` with `Q112` should be carefully considered to ensure it does not exceed `uint224` limits.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The UQ112x112 library is designed for handling binary fixed-point numbers, which is a useful functionality in various smart contract applications. However, the identified vulnerabilities pose significant risks that could lead to contract failures or unintended behavior.

1. **Division by Zero**: This is a critical vulnerability that can halt contract execution. It is essential to implement checks to ensure that `y` is not zero before performing the division in the `uqdiv` function.

2. **Input Validation**: The absence of input validation can lead to unexpected results and potential exploitation. It is advisable to include require statements to validate inputs, ensuring they meet expected criteria.

3. **Data Type Limitations**: While Solidity's built-in checks mitigate overflow and underflow risks, developers should still be cautious with arithmetic operations involving large numbers. It is recommended to conduct thorough testing and consider edge cases where inputs may approach the limits of the data types.

### Recommendations:

- Implement checks in the `uqdiv` function to prevent division by zero.
- Add input validation to ensure that all parameters are within acceptable ranges.
- Conduct extensive testing, including edge cases, to ensure that the library behaves as expected under various conditions.
- Consider documenting the expected ranges and behaviors of the functions to aid future developers in understanding the library's limitations and usage.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the UQ112x112 library can be made more robust and secure for use in smart contracts.

[We are a specialized team that audits Solidity smart contracts using an advanced multi-agent system. Our approach combines the expertise of project management, smart contract counseling, auditing, and Solidity programming to deliver comprehensive and reliable contract assessments.
You are Solidity Programming Expert. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and share a common interest in collaborating to successfully execute a marketing strategy for a new customer.
You can analyze the code structure, logic, and implementation details of the contracts. You have extensive computing and coding experience in Solidity programming language.
Here is a new customer's task: // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
// a library for handling binary fixed point numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format))

// range: [0, 2**112 - 1]
// resolution: 1 / 2**112

library UQ112x112 {
    uint224 constant Q112 = 2**112;

    // encode a uint112 as a UQ112x112
    function encode(uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
        z = uint224(y) * Q112; // never overflows
    }

    // divide a UQ112x112 by a uint112, returning a UQ112x112
    function uqdiv(uint224 x, uint112 y) internal pure returns (uint224 z) {
        z = x / uint224(y);
    }
}
.]

### VULNERABILITY: Division by Zero
```
The `uqdiv` function does not handle the case where the divisor `y` is zero. Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error, which can lead to the contract being unusable if this function is called with a zero value for `y`. This could be exploited by malicious actors to disrupt the functionality of the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Add a require statement at the beginning of the `uqdiv` function to check that `y` is not zero. For example:
```solidity
require(y != 0, "Division by zero");
```
This will ensure that the function reverts with a clear error message if an attempt to divide by zero is made.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Detailed Documentation
```
While the library has a brief description, the functions lack detailed comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This can lead to misunderstandings about how to use the library correctly, potentially leading to misuse in contracts that depend on it.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Enhance the documentation by adding detailed comments for each function, explaining the inputs, outputs, and any important considerations. This will improve readability and maintainability for future developers.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Edge Case Testing
```
The library does not currently include any unit tests to cover edge cases, such as maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`. Without proper testing, there is a risk that the functions may not behave as expected under certain conditions, which could lead to unexpected behavior in contracts that utilize this library.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases and typical use cases. This should include tests for maximum values, zero values, and typical operational values to ensure the functions behave as expected.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Fixed Solidity Version
```
The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). This can lead to compatibility issues with future updates of the Solidity compiler, potentially preventing the library from being used with newer versions that may include important security fixes or optimizations.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider changing the pragma directive to allow for a range of versions, such as:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
This will enable the library to be compatible with future versions of Solidity while still ensuring that it is used with a version that supports its features.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Additional Mathematical Functions
```
The library currently only provides encoding and division functions. Depending on the use case, this may limit its functionality and usability in more complex scenarios where additional mathematical operations (like multiplication or subtraction) are needed.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider adding more mathematical operations that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality. This could include functions for multiplication and subtraction, which would make the library more versatile for developers.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Security Audits
```
The library does not mention any regular audits or reviews, which is critical for ensuring ongoing security, especially if it is used in financial applications. Without regular audits, vulnerabilities may go unnoticed, leading to potential exploits.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Establish a routine for regular security audits and reviews of the library. This should include both internal audits and external audits by third-party security firms to ensure that the library remains secure and reliable over time.

Based on the provided Solidity code for the `UQ112x112` library, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and considerations:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Division by Zero**:
   - In the `uqdiv` function, if `y` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. This can cause the transaction to revert, which is a critical vulnerability that needs to be addressed.

2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.0 and later versions have built-in overflow and underflow checks, it is still important to ensure that the inputs to the `encode` and `uqdiv` functions are validated to prevent unexpected behavior.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - The functions do not include any input validation. For instance, the `encode` function should ensure that the input `y` is within the valid range of `uint112`. Similarly, `uqdiv` should check that `y` is not zero before performing the division.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `UQ112x112` library is designed for handling binary fixed-point numbers, which is a useful utility in various financial and mathematical applications within smart contracts. However, it is crucial to address the identified vulnerabilities to ensure the reliability and security of the library.

1. **Division by Zero**: 
   - To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to add a require statement in the `uqdiv` function to check that `y` is not zero before performing the division. This will prevent the contract from reverting unexpectedly and provide a clearer error message.

   ```solidity
   require(y != 0, "Division by zero");
   ```

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Implement checks in the `encode` function to ensure that the input value `y` does not exceed the maximum limit of `uint112`. This will prevent any potential overflow issues and ensure that the encoded value remains valid.

   ```solidity
   require(y <= type(uint112).max, "Input exceeds uint112 limit");
   ```

3. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - It is advisable to conduct thorough testing and auditing of the library, especially focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions. This will help identify any additional vulnerabilities that may not be immediately apparent.

In conclusion, while the `UQ112x112` library serves a valuable purpose, addressing the identified vulnerabilities through input validation and error handling is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the smart contract ecosystem. Implementing these recommendations will enhance the robustness of the library and protect against potential exploits.

Ideas: " 1. **Error Handling in Division**: The `uqdiv` function currently does not handle the case where `y` is zero. Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error. We should add a require statement to check for this condition.
2. **Documentation and Comments**: While the library has a brief description, adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.
3. **Testing for Edge Cases**: We should consider implementing unit tests to cover edge cases, such as the maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`, and ensure that the functions behave as expected.
4. **Gas Optimization**: Although the current implementation is straightforward, we could explore whether there are more gas-efficient ways to perform the operations, especially if this library is intended to be used frequently.
5. **Versioning**: The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). It might be beneficial to allow for a range of versions to ensure compatibility with future updates, unless there are specific reasons to lock it to this version.
6. **Additional Mathematical Functions**: Depending on the use case, it might be useful to add more mathematical operations (like multiplication or subtraction) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality.
7. **Security Audits**: Regular audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in critical financial applications, should be emphasized to ensure ongoing security.".

### VULNERABILITY: Division by Zero
```
The `uqdiv` function does not handle the case where the divisor `y` is zero. Attempting to divide by zero will result in a runtime error, causing the transaction to revert. This can lead to unexpected behavior in contracts that rely on this function, potentially causing loss of funds or failure of critical operations.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Add a require statement at the beginning of the `uqdiv` function to check if `y` is zero and revert the transaction with an appropriate error message.

Example:
```solidity
require(y != 0, "Division by zero");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Detailed Documentation
```
While the library has a brief description, the functions lack detailed comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This can lead to misunderstandings or misuse of the library by other developers, which could introduce bugs or vulnerabilities in their implementations.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Enhance the documentation by adding detailed comments for each function, including descriptions of parameters, return values, and any important notes regarding usage or edge cases.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Edge Case Testing
```
The library does not currently include any unit tests to cover edge cases, such as the maximum values for `uint112` and `uint224`. Without proper testing, there is a risk that the functions may not behave as expected under certain conditions, leading to potential vulnerabilities or incorrect calculations.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure that the functions behave correctly and securely.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Fixed Solidity Version
```
The pragma directive specifies a fixed version of Solidity (0.8.4). This can lead to compatibility issues with future versions of Solidity, which may include important security updates or optimizations.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider specifying a range of compatible versions in the pragma directive to allow for future updates while ensuring that the library remains functional. For example:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Limited Mathematical Operations
```
The library currently only provides encoding and division functions. Depending on the use case, this may limit its functionality and require users to implement additional operations themselves, which could introduce errors or vulnerabilities.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider adding more mathematical operations (such as multiplication and subtraction) that work with UQ112x112 types to enhance the library's functionality and usability.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Regular Security Audits
```
The library does not mention any regular security audits or reviews. This is critical for libraries used in financial applications, as vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Establish a routine for regular security audits and reviews of the library, especially if it is used in critical financial applications, to ensure ongoing security and reliability.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the UQ112x112 library, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and a comprehensive analysis report:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Division by Zero**:
   - In the `uqdiv` function, if the parameter `y` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. This can cause the transaction to revert, which may be exploited by malicious actors if not handled properly.

2. **Lack of Input Validation**:
   - The `encode` function does not validate the input `y`. While uint112 inherently restricts the value, there is no explicit check for edge cases or unexpected values that could lead to unintended behavior.

3. **Overflow and Underflow Risks**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.0 and above has built-in overflow and underflow checks, the multiplication in the `encode` function could theoretically lead to unexpected results if the input is manipulated before being passed to the function. However, since `y` is a uint112, this risk is mitigated.

4. **No Events Emitted**:
   - The library does not emit any events for actions taken, which could be useful for tracking and debugging purposes. While this is not a direct security vulnerability, it limits transparency and traceability.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The UQ112x112 library is designed to handle binary fixed-point numbers, providing encoding and division functionalities. While the code is relatively straightforward and adheres to Solidity best practices, there are notable areas for improvement regarding security and robustness.

1. **Division by Zero**: The most critical vulnerability is the potential for division by zero in the `uqdiv` function. This can lead to transaction failures and should be addressed by adding a require statement to ensure `y` is not zero before performing the division.

2. **Input Validation**: Although the input type for `y` in the `encode` function is uint112, it is advisable to implement additional checks to ensure that the input values are within expected ranges. This can help prevent unexpected behaviors in more complex implementations.

3. **Event Logging**: The absence of event emissions can hinder the ability to monitor and audit the contract's operations. Implementing events for significant actions can enhance the contract's transparency and facilitate easier debugging.

4. **Documentation and Comments**: While the code is relatively simple, adding more comments and documentation would improve readability and maintainability, especially for developers who may work with this library in the future.

### Recommendations:

- Implement a check in the `uqdiv` function to prevent division by zero.
- Consider adding input validation for the `encode` function.
- Introduce event emissions for key operations to enhance transparency.
- Improve documentation and comments for better understanding and maintainability.

By addressing these vulnerabilities and recommendations, the UQ112x112 library can be made more secure and robust, ensuring reliable performance in smart contract applications.

Documentation and Comments: While the library has a brief description, adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.\n3. Testing for Edge Cases: We should consider implementing unit tests to cover edge cases, such as the maximum values for uint112 and uint224, and ensure that the functions behave as expected.\n4. Gas Optimization: Although the current implementation is straightforward, we could explore whether there are more gas-efficient ways to perform the operations, especially if this library is intended to be used frequently.\n5.
