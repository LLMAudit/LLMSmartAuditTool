Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code and brainstorm potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Input Validation**: The `percOf` and `percPoints` functions do not validate the denominator (`_fracDenom`). If `_fracDenom` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. We should add a check to ensure that `_fracDenom` is greater than zero before performing the division.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The `validPerc` function could be optimized by using a require statement to revert the transaction if the percentage is invalid. This would save gas by preventing unnecessary calculations in subsequent functions.

3. **Event Logging**: Consider adding events to log significant actions or results, especially in functions that compute percentages. This would help in tracking the usage of the library and debugging.

4. **Library Versioning**: The current version of Solidity is quite old (`^0.5.11`). It would be beneficial to update the pragma statement to a more recent version (e.g., `^0.8.0`) to take advantage of the latest features and security improvements.

5. **Documentation**: While the code has some comments, enhancing the documentation to include examples of how to use the functions could improve usability for developers who might use this library.

6. **Reentrancy Guard**: Although this library does not directly deal with state changes or external calls, if it were to be integrated into a contract that does, it would be prudent to consider implementing a reentrancy guard.

7. **Unit Tests**: Ensure that there are comprehensive unit tests for each function in the library to validate their correctness and edge cases.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract code and brainstorm potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Input Validation**: The `percOf` and `percPoints` functions do not validate the denominator (`_fracDenom`). If `_fracDenom` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. We should add a check to ensure that `_fracDenom` is greater than zero before performing the division.
2. **Gas Optimization**: The `validPerc` function could be optimized by using a require statement to revert the transaction if the percentage is invalid. This would save gas by preventing unnecessary calculations in subsequent functions.
3. **Event Logging**: Consider adding events to log significant actions or results, especially in functions that compute percentages. This would help in tracking the usage of the library and debugging.

Ideas: " 1. **Input Validation**: The `percOf` and `percPoints` functions do not validate the denominator (`_fracDenom`). If `_fracDenom` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error. We should add a check to ensure that `_fracDenom` is greater than zero before performing the division.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The `validPerc` function could be optimized by using a require statement to revert the transaction if the percentage is invalid. This would save gas by preventing unnecessary calculations in subsequent functions.

3. **Event Logging**: Consider adding events to log significant actions or results, especially in functions that compute percentages. This would help in tracking the usage of the library and debugging.

4. **Library Versioning**: The current version of Solidity is quite old (`^0.5.11`). It would be beneficial to update the pragma statement to a more recent version (e.g., `^0.8.0`) to take advantage of the latest features and security improvements.

5. **Documentation**: While the code has some comments, enhancing the documentation to include examples of how to use the functions could improve usability for developers who might use this library.
