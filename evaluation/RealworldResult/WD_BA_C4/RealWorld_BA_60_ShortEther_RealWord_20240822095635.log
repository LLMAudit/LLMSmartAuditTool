Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract and identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement.

1. **Input Validation**: The `rate` function currently does not validate the inputs of the `position` struct. We should ensure that both `maker` and `taker` values are non-negative and that `maker` is not zero before performing calculations. This could prevent unexpected behavior or division by zero errors.

2. **Event Emission**: The contract lacks event emissions for critical state changes or calculations. Emitting events for functions like `payoff`, `rate`, and any other significant actions can improve transparency and allow for better tracking of contract activity.

3. **Gas Optimization**: The `rate` function performs multiple calculations that could potentially be optimized for gas efficiency. For example, we could cache the result of `Fixed18Lib.from(capped)` instead of calling it multiple times.

4. **Access Control**: If there are functions that should only be callable by certain roles (e.g., only the owner or an admin), we should implement access control mechanisms using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl` contracts.

5. **Upgradeability**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing state or requiring users to migrate to a new contract.

6. **Testing and Audit**: Ensure that comprehensive unit tests are written for all functions, especially for edge cases. Additionally, a third-party audit could be beneficial to identify any vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during development.

7. **Documentation**: Adding NatSpec comments to the functions can help other developers understand the purpose and usage of each function better.

8. **Security Checks**: Implement checks for potential reentrancy attacks, especially in functions that might interact with external contracts or handle Ether.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any other ideas in mind?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided Solidity contract and identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement.
1. **Input Validation**: The `rate` function currently does not validate the inputs of the `position` struct. We should ensure that both `maker` and `taker` values are non-negative and that `maker` is not zero before performing calculations. This could prevent unexpected behavior or division by zero errors.
2. **Event Emission**: The contract lacks event emissions for critical state changes or calculations. Emitting events for functions like `payoff`, `rate`, and any other significant actions can improve transparency and allow for better tracking of contract activity.
3. **Gas Optimization**: The `rate` function performs multiple calculations that could potentially be optimized for gas efficiency. For example, we could cache the result of `Fixed18Lib.from(capped)` instead of calling it multiple times.
4. **Access Control**: If there are functions that should only be callable by certain roles (e.g., only the owner or an admin), we should implement access control mechanisms using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl` contracts.
5. **Upgradeability**: Consider implementing a proxy pattern for upgradeability. This would allow the contract to be upgraded in the future without losing state or requiring users to migrate to a new contract.
6. **Testing and Audit**: Ensure that comprehensive unit tests are written for all functions, especially for edge cases. Additionally, a third-party audit could be beneficial to identify any vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during development.
7. **Documentation**: Adding NatSpec comments to the functions can help other developers understand the purpose and usage of each function better.
8. **Security Checks**: Implement checks for potential reentrancy attacks, especially in functions that might interact with external contracts or handle Ether.

As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Input Validation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `rate` function does not validate the inputs of the `Position` struct, particularly the `maker` and `taker` values. If these values are manipulated or set to unexpected values (e.g., negative values or extremely large numbers), it could lead to incorrect calculations or even division by zero in the `utilization` calculation.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: This could result in incorrect rates being calculated, leading to financial losses for users or unintended behavior in the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement input validation checks to ensure that `position.maker` and `position.taker` are non-negative and within a reasonable range before performing calculations. For example:
```solidity
require(position.maker > 0, "Maker must be greater than zero");
require(position.taker >= 0, "Taker must be non-negative");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Division by Zero
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: In the `rate` function, there is a potential for division by zero if `position.maker` is zero, which is currently handled by returning `Fixed18Lib.ZERO`. However, if the check is removed or if the `maker` value is manipulated, it could lead to a runtime error.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: Division by zero can cause the transaction to revert, leading to a denial of service for users trying to interact with the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure that the check for `position.maker.isZero()` is always present and consider adding additional checks to prevent any manipulation of the `maker` value that could lead to this condition.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as rate calculation, payoff, or fee retrieval. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for users and external systems to track important state changes.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: Without events, it becomes challenging to audit and monitor contract activity, which can lead to trust issues among users and hinder debugging efforts.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement event emissions for key functions. For example:
```solidity
event RateCalculated(Fixed18 rate);
event PayoffCalculated(Fixed18 payoff);
```
Emit these events at the end of the respective functions to provide transparency and traceability.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation of the `rate` function involves multiple calculations that could be optimized for gas efficiency. For example, the use of multiple calls to `Fixed18Lib.from` can be reduced.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: High gas costs can deter users from interacting with the contract, especially during high network congestion.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Review the calculations in the `rate` function and optimize them to reduce the number of operations and function calls. For instance, you can store intermediate results in variables to avoid redundant calculations.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded Values
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `makerLimit` function returns a hardcoded value of 1000. While this may be intentional, hardcoding values can limit flexibility and adaptability of the contract.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: If the limit needs to change in the future, it would require a contract upgrade, which can be costly and time-consuming.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider making the limit configurable through a state variable that can be set during contract deployment or through a governance mechanism.

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract code for the `ShortEther` contract, here is a succinct summary of potential security vulnerabilities and issues identified:

### Security Vulnerabilities Summary:

1. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The contract uses fixed-point arithmetic without explicit checks for overflow or underflow. Although Solidity 0.8.x has built-in overflow and underflow checks, it is still important to ensure that the logic correctly handles edge cases, especially when dealing with financial calculations.

2. **Division by Zero**:
   - The `rate` function performs a division operation (`position.taker.div(position.maker)`) without checking if `position.maker` is zero. Although there is a check at the beginning of the function, it is crucial to ensure that all paths leading to division are safe.

3. **External Calls**:
   - The contract inherits from `ProductProviderBase`, and if that contract makes external calls (e.g., to oracles or other contracts), there could be reentrancy vulnerabilities. It is essential to review the base contract to ensure that it does not expose the `ShortEther` contract to reentrancy attacks.

4. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms (e.g., `onlyOwner` modifiers) for functions that might require restricted access. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions if the contract is extended or modified in the future.

5. **Magic Numbers**:
   - The use of hardcoded values (e.g., `365 days`, `30/100`, `10/100`, and `1000`) can lead to issues with maintainability and readability. It is advisable to define these values as constants or configurable parameters to enhance clarity and flexibility.

6. **Potential Misuse of Fixed18 and UFixed18**:
   - The contract relies on external libraries for fixed-point arithmetic. If these libraries are not thoroughly audited or if they contain vulnerabilities, it could compromise the security of the `ShortEther` contract.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `ShortEther` contract appears to implement a financial product with various functions related to rates, fees, and limits. While the contract leverages fixed-point arithmetic for precision, it is essential to address the identified vulnerabilities to ensure the contract's security and reliability.

1. **Arithmetic Safety**: Although Solidity 0.8.x provides built-in checks, it is crucial to ensure that all arithmetic operations are safe and that the logic accounts for potential edge cases.

2. **Division Safety**: The contract should ensure that any division operation is safe from division by zero errors, even if checks are in place.

3. **Reentrancy Risks**: A thorough review of the base contract and any external calls is necessary to mitigate reentrancy risks.

4. **Access Control**: Implementing access control mechanisms will help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

5. **Maintainability**: Refactoring hardcoded values into constants or configurable parameters will improve the maintainability of the contract.

6. **Library Audits**: Ensure that the libraries used for fixed-point arithmetic are audited and free from vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, while the `ShortEther` contract has a solid foundation, addressing the identified vulnerabilities will enhance its security posture and ensure that it operates as intended in a production environment. A thorough audit of both the contract and its dependencies is recommended before deployment.

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Input Validation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `rate` function does not validate the inputs of the `Position` struct. If the `position.taker` or `position.maker` values are negative or if `position.maker` is zero (which is already checked), it could lead to unexpected behavior or division by zero errors. Although the current implementation checks for zero, it does not handle negative values, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement input validation to ensure that both `position.taker` and `position.maker` are non-negative before performing any calculations. This can be done by adding require statements at the beginning of the function:
```solidity
require(position.taker >= 0, "Taker amount must be non-negative");
require(position.maker > 0, "Maker amount must be greater than zero");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not emit any events for critical state changes or function calls. This lack of event emission can hinder the ability to track contract interactions and changes, making it difficult for users and developers to monitor the contract's activity.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Introduce event declarations and emit events in functions such as `payoff`, `rate`, and any other relevant functions to log important actions and state changes. For example:
```solidity
event RateCalculated(Fixed18 rate);
event PayoffCalculated(Fixed18 payoff);
```
Then, emit these events in the respective functions:
```solidity
emit RateCalculated(centered.div(Fixed18Lib.from(365 days)));
emit PayoffCalculated(Fixed18Lib.from(-1).mul(price));
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Potential Division by Zero
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: While the `rate` function checks if `position.maker` is zero, it does not check if `position.taker` is zero before performing the division operation. If `position.maker` is zero, the function returns zero, but if `position.taker` is also zero, it could lead to a division by zero error.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure that `position.maker` is greater than zero before performing the division. This is partially handled by the existing check, but it should be explicitly stated that both values should be checked to avoid confusion:
```solidity
require(position.maker > 0, "Maker amount must be greater than zero");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Fixed Values in Fee Functions
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `makerFee` and `takerFee` functions return fixed values of zero. While this may be intentional, it could limit flexibility in the future if the contract needs to adapt to changing fee structures or business logic.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider implementing a mechanism to set and update fees dynamically, allowing for greater flexibility. This could involve adding state variables for fees and functions to update them, ensuring that the contract can adapt to future requirements.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation of the `rate` function involves multiple calculations and conversions that may not be gas efficient. For example, the use of `Fixed18Lib.from(capped)` and `Fixed18Lib.from(2)` could be optimized.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Review the calculations in the `rate` function to minimize the number of conversions and calculations performed. For instance, consider caching results of repeated calculations or simplifying the mathematical operations where possible to reduce gas costs.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, which could lead to unauthorized access to certain functions, especially if the contract is intended to be used in a multi-user environment.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or similar pattern to restrict access to sensitive functions. This will help ensure that only authorized users can call certain functions, enhancing the security of the contract.

[2024-22-08 09:57:10 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Input Validation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `rate` function does not validate the inputs of the `Position` struct. If the `position.taker` or `position.maker` values are negative or if `position.maker` is zero (which is already checked), it could lead to unexpected behavior or division by zero errors. Although the current implementation checks for zero, it does not handle negative values, which could lead to incorrect calculations.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement input validation to ensure that both `position.taker` and `position.maker` are non-negative before performing any calculations. This can be done by adding require statements at the beginning of the function:
```solidity
require(position.taker >= 0, "Taker amount must be non-negative");
require(position.maker > 0, "Maker amount must be greater than zero");
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not emit any events for critical state changes or function calls. This lack of event emission can hinder the ability to track contract interactions and changes, making it difficult for users and developers to monitor the contract's activity.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Introduce event declarations and emit events in functions such as `payoff`, `rate`, and any other relevant functions to log important actions and state changes. For example:
```solidity
event RateCalculated(Fixed18 rate);
event PayoffCalculated(Fixed18 payoff);
```
Then, emit these events in the respective functions:
```solidity
emit RateCalculated(centered.div(Fixed18Lib.from(365 days)));
emit PayoffCalculated(Fixed18Lib.from(-1).mul(price));
```
```

### VULNERABILITY: Potential Division by Zero
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: While the `rate` function checks if `position.maker` is zero, it does not check if `position.taker` is zero before performing the division operation. If `position.maker` is zero, the function returns zero, but if `position.taker` is also zero, it could lead to a division by zero error.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure that `position.maker` is greater than zero before performing the division. This is partially handled by the existing check, but it should be explicitly stated that both values should be checked to avoid confusion:

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract code for the `ShortEther` contract, here is a summary of potential security vulnerabilities and issues identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Division by Zero**: 
   - In the `rate` function, the division `position.taker.div(position.maker)` could lead to a division by zero if `position.maker` is zero. Although there is a check for `position.maker.isZero()`, it is crucial to ensure that this check is always valid and that `position.taker` is also appropriately validated.

2. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The functions in the contract do not implement any access control mechanisms. This could allow unauthorized users to call functions like `payoff`, `maintenance`, `fundingFee`, `makerFee`, `takerFee`, and `makerLimit`, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

3. **Potential Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.0 and above has built-in overflow and underflow checks, it is still important to ensure that all arithmetic operations are safe, particularly when dealing with user inputs. The use of `Fixed18Lib` and `UFixed18Lib` should be carefully reviewed to ensure they handle edge cases correctly.

4. **Magic Numbers**:
   - The use of hardcoded values (e.g., `365 days`, `30`, `10`, `1000`) without clear context or explanation can lead to confusion. It is advisable to define these values as constants with descriptive names to improve code readability and maintainability.

5. **Lack of Event Emission**:
   - The contract does not emit any events for state changes or important actions. Emitting events is a best practice for tracking contract interactions and can aid in debugging and monitoring.

6. **No Validation of Inputs**:
   - The contract does not validate the inputs to the functions, especially in the `payoff` function. It is important to ensure that the inputs are within expected ranges to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `ShortEther` contract implements a product provider for shorting Ether, leveraging fixed-point arithmetic for financial calculations. While the contract is structured to perform its intended functions, several security vulnerabilities and best practice violations have been identified:

- **Division by Zero**: The potential for division by zero exists, which could lead to contract failure. It is essential to ensure that all divisions are safeguarded against zero denominators.
  
- **Access Control**: The absence of access control mechanisms poses a risk of unauthorized access to critical functions. Implementing role-based access control would enhance the security of the contract.

- **Arithmetic Safety**: Although Solidity provides built-in protections against overflow and underflow, the use of external libraries necessitates a thorough review to ensure they are robust against edge cases.

- **Magic Numbers**: The presence of hardcoded values can lead to misunderstandings and errors. Defining constants with meaningful names would improve code clarity.

- **Event Emission**: The lack of events for state changes limits the ability to track contract activity. Adding events for significant actions would improve transparency and facilitate monitoring.

- **Input Validation**: The contract should validate inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges, preventing unexpected behavior and potential exploits.

In conclusion, while the `ShortEther` contract demonstrates a solid foundation for its intended functionality, addressing the identified vulnerabilities and adhering to best practices will significantly enhance its security and reliability. It is recommended to implement the suggested improvements before deploying the contract in a production environment.

As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Input Validation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not validate the inputs for the `rate` and `payoff` functions. Specifically, the `position` parameter in the `rate` function and the `price` parameter in the `payoff` function could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if they contain invalid or malicious values. For example, if `position.maker` or `position.taker` are negative or excessively large, it could lead to incorrect calculations or overflow issues.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the values of `position.maker` and `position.taker` are within acceptable ranges (e.g., non-negative and not excessively large). Additionally, consider adding require statements to enforce these checks.
```

VULNERABILITY: Potential Division by Zero
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: In the `rate` function, there is a division operation `position.taker.div(position.maker)`. If `position.maker` is zero, the function returns `Fixed18Lib.ZERO`, which prevents division by zero in this case. However, if this check is not properly handled in other parts of the contract or if the logic changes in the future, it could lead to a division by zero error.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure that all division operations are safeguarded by checks that prevent division by zero. This can be done by using require statements to validate that the denominator is not zero before performing any division.
```

VULNERABILITY: Missing Event Emission
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not emit any events for significant state changes or function calls. This lack of event emission can hinder transparency and traceability, making it difficult for users and developers to track contract activity and state changes.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Introduce event declarations for important actions within the contract, such as when rates are calculated, payoffs are made, and fees are set. Emit these events at appropriate points in the contract to enhance transparency and allow for easier monitoring of contract interactions.
```

VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded Values
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract contains hardcoded values for fees and limits (e.g., maintenance fee, funding fee, maker limit). While these values may be appropriate for the current implementation, hardcoding them can limit flexibility and adaptability in the future. Changes to these values would require redeployment of the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider making these values configurable by allowing the contract owner or an authorized entity to update them through designated functions. This would provide greater flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions.
```

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Access Control
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The functions in the contract do not implement any access control mechanisms. This means that any user can call these functions, which could lead to unintended consequences, especially if the contract is extended or modified in the future.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement access control mechanisms using modifiers (e.g., `onlyOwner`, `onlyAuthorized`) to restrict access to certain functions. This will help ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations within the contract.
```

VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization Issues
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation may not be optimized for gas usage, particularly in the `rate` function where multiple calculations are performed. This could lead to higher transaction costs for users.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Review the calculations and consider optimizing them by minimizing the number of operations and using more efficient data types where applicable. Additionally, consider caching frequently used values to reduce redundant calculations.

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract code for the `ShortEther` contract, here is a summary of potential security vulnerabilities and issues identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Division by Zero**: 
   - In the `rate` function, the division `position.taker.div(position.maker)` could lead to a division by zero error if `position.maker` is zero. Although the function checks if `position.maker` is zero and returns `Fixed18Lib.ZERO`, it is essential to ensure that `position.taker` is also validated to avoid unexpected behavior.

2. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms for its functions. This could allow unauthorized users to call functions that may alter the state or perform sensitive operations.

3. **Magic Numbers**:
   - The use of hardcoded values such as `365 days` in the `rate` function and `30/100` in the `maintenance` function can lead to confusion. It is advisable to define these values as constants or configurable parameters to enhance readability and maintainability.

4. **Potential Overflow/Underflow**:
   - Although Solidity 0.8.x has built-in overflow and underflow checks, it is still important to ensure that all arithmetic operations are safe and do not lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with fixed-point arithmetic.

5. **No Event Emission**:
   - The contract does not emit any events for critical state changes or function calls. Emitting events is crucial for tracking contract activity and can aid in debugging and monitoring.

6. **Lack of Input Validation**:
   - The contract does not perform input validation on the parameters passed to the functions. For example, ensuring that the values in `position` are within expected ranges can prevent erroneous calculations.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `ShortEther` contract implements a product provider for a financial application, utilizing fixed-point arithmetic for rate calculations and fee management. While the contract appears to have a structured approach to its core functionalities, several security vulnerabilities and best practice violations have been identified:

- **Division by Zero**: The contract should ensure that all divisions are safe and validate inputs rigorously to prevent runtime errors.
- **Access Control**: Implementing access control mechanisms is essential to restrict function calls to authorized users only, thereby enhancing the security of the contract.
- **Magic Numbers**: The use of hardcoded values reduces code clarity. Defining constants or using configuration parameters would improve maintainability.
- **Event Emission**: The absence of event emissions can hinder the ability to track contract interactions. Events should be emitted for significant actions to facilitate monitoring.
- **Input Validation**: Validating inputs before processing them is critical to ensure that the contract behaves as expected and to prevent potential exploits.

In conclusion, while the `ShortEther` contract has a solid foundation, addressing the identified vulnerabilities and adhering to best practices will significantly enhance its security and reliability. It is recommended to conduct a thorough review and testing of the contract, including unit tests and integration tests, to ensure all functionalities work as intended and to mitigate any potential risks.

Based on the provided test report stating that the software ran successfully without errors, it appears that there are no immediate bugs causing issues within the contract codes. The contract seems to be functioning as intended without any visible errors during the test execution.

However, to ensure a comprehensive assessment, it is recommended to conduct a more thorough security audit and testing to identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may not be apparent from a simple successful run test report. This can include analyzing potential exploit paths, assessing the resilience of the contract to common attack vectors, and suggesting remediation measures to enhance the contract's security.

In conclusion, while the initial test report indicates a successful run without errors, further security testing and auditing are advisable to ensure the robustness and security of the ShortEther contract.
