Let's analyze the provided contract and discuss potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Error Handling**: The contract currently uses a custom error for reentrant calls. We could consider adding more detailed error messages or additional custom errors for different failure scenarios. This would improve debugging and provide clearer feedback to developers and users.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The contract uses a `uint256` for the status, which is more expensive than using a `bool`. Since we only need two states (_NOT_ENTERED and _ENTERED), we could simplify this to a `bool` type. However, this would require careful consideration of the implications for upgradeability and storage patterns.

3. **Visibility of Functions**: The `_status()` and `_setStatus()` functions are private. We might want to consider whether they should be internal instead, allowing derived contracts to access these functions if needed. This could enhance flexibility for future extensions.

4. **Upgradeability Considerations**: Since this contract is designed to be used with upgradeable contracts, we should ensure that the storage pattern is well-documented and that any derived contracts maintain compatibility. We could also implement a versioning system to track changes in the contract.

5. **Testing and Auditing**: We should emphasize the importance of thorough testing and auditing of the contract, especially since it deals with reentrancy, which is a critical security concern. Implementing automated tests and formal verification could enhance trust in the contract's security.

6. **Documentation**: While the contract has some comments, we could improve the documentation further. Adding NatSpec comments for all public and external functions would help users understand the contract's functionality better.

7. **Additional Security Measures**: We could explore integrating other security patterns, such as checks-effects-interactions or circuit breakers, to provide additional layers of security against various attack vectors.

What do you think about these suggestions? Are there any specific areas you would like to focus on or explore further?

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided contract and discuss potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Error Handling**: The contract currently uses a custom error for reentrant calls. We could consider adding more detailed error messages or additional custom errors for different failure scenarios. This would improve debugging and provide clearer feedback to developers and users.
2. **Gas Optimization**: The contract uses a `uint256` for the status, which is more expensive than using a `bool`. Since we only need two states (_NOT_ENTERED and _ENTERED), we could simplify this to a `bool` type. However, this would require careful consideration of the implications for upgradeability and storage patterns.
3. **Visibility of Functions**: The `_status()` and `_setStatus()` functions are private. We might want to consider whether they should be internal instead, allowing derived contracts to access these functions if needed. This could enhance flexibility for future extensions.
4. **Upgradeability Considerations**: Since this contract is designed to be used with upgradeable contracts, we should ensure that the storage pattern is well-documented and that any derived contracts maintain compatibility. We could also implement a versioning system to track changes in the contract.
5. **Testing and Auditing**: We should emphasize the importance of thorough testing and auditing of the contract, especially since it deals with reentrancy, which is a critical security concern. Implementing automated tests and formal verification could enhance trust in the contract's security.
6. **Documentation**: While the contract has some comments, we could improve the documentation further. Adding NatSpec comments for all public and external functions would help users understand the contract's functionality better.
7. **Additional Security Measures**: We could explore integrating other security patterns, such as checks-effects-interactions or circuit breakers, to provide additional layers of security against various attack vectors.
What do you think about these suggestions? Are there any specific areas you would like to focus on or explore further? Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"

As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Detailed Error Handling
```
The contract currently uses a single custom error for reentrancy checks. While this is a good practice, it lacks detailed context about the failure. If a reentrancy attack is attempted, the error does not provide information on which function was called or the state of the contract at the time of the call. This can make debugging difficult.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement more granular error handling by adding context to the error messages. For example, you could create specific errors for different functions that might fail due to reentrancy, providing more insight into the failure.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
The contract uses `uint256` for the reentrancy status, which is more expensive in terms of gas usage compared to using a `bool`. Given that the status only needs to represent two states (entered or not entered), using a `bool` would be more efficient.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Change the `_NOT_ENTERED` and `_ENTERED` constants to a `bool` type, simplifying the storage and reducing gas costs.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Function Visibility
```
The functions `_status()` and `_setStatus()` are marked as private. This limits their visibility strictly to the contract itself, which may not be necessary. If these functions need to be accessed by derived contracts, marking them as internal would be more appropriate.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Change the visibility of `_status()` and `_setStatus()` from private to internal to allow derived contracts to utilize these functions if needed.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Considerations
```
While the contract mentions compatibility with upgradeable contracts, there is no versioning system or mechanism to handle upgrades safely. This could lead to issues if the contract needs to be upgraded in the future, especially if the storage layout changes.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement a versioning system and ensure that any changes to the contract's storage layout are handled carefully to maintain compatibility with existing data.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Testing and Auditing
```
The contract does not mention any testing or auditing practices. Without thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests, vulnerabilities may go unnoticed. Additionally, formal verification could help ensure the contract behaves as expected.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Emphasize the importance of automated testing and consider conducting a formal verification process to ensure the contract's security and functionality.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Insufficient Documentation
```
The NatSpec comments are present but could be improved for clarity and completeness. Insufficient documentation can lead to misunderstandings about how the contract functions, making it harder for developers to use or audit the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Improve the NatSpec comments to provide clearer explanations of the contract's purpose, functions, and potential risks. This will enhance understanding for future developers and auditors.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Additional Security Measures
```
The contract does not implement additional security measures such as checks-effects-interactions or circuit breakers. These patterns can help prevent common vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate risks associated with external calls. Additionally, a circuit breaker mechanism could be introduced to pause contract operations in case of detected vulnerabilities or attacks.

The contract does not mention any testing or auditing practices. Without thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests, vulnerabilities may go unnoticed. Additionally, formal verification could help ensure the contract behaves as expected.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Emphasize the importance of automated testing and consider conducting a formal verification process to ensure the contract's security and functionality.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Insufficient Documentation
```
The NatSpec comments are present but could be improved for clarity and completeness. Insufficient documentation can lead to misunderstandings about how the contract functions, making it harder for developers to use or audit the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Improve the NatSpec comments to provide clearer explanations of the contract's purpose, functions, and potential risks. This will enhance understanding for future developers and auditors.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Additional Security Measures
```
The contract does not implement additional security measures such as checks-effects-interactions or circuit breakers. These patterns can help prevent common vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of the contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate risks associated with external calls. Additionally, a circuit breaker mechanism could be introduced to pause contract operations in case of detected vulnerabilities or attacks.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `UReentrancyGuard` contract, here is a summary of the security vulnerabilities identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**:
   - The contract is designed to prevent reentrant calls, but if not used correctly, it can still be susceptible to reentrancy attacks. The `nonReentrant` modifier must be applied properly to all external functions that modify state.

2. **Storage Slot Manipulation**:
   - The use of unstructured storage patterns introduces complexity. If the storage slot is not managed correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts with other contracts that might use the same storage slot.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The contract uses a custom error `UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError`, which is good for gas efficiency. However, if the error handling is not properly documented or understood by developers using this contract, it could lead to confusion during implementation.

4. **Gas Optimization**:
   - The comments mention that using booleans for the reentrancy status is more expensive than using uint256. While this is a design choice, it is essential to ensure that the gas costs are justified by the security benefits provided.

5. **Modifier Limitations**:
   - The `nonReentrant` modifier cannot be used on functions that call each other. This limitation must be clearly communicated to developers to avoid potential misuse.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `UReentrancyGuard` contract is a well-structured implementation aimed at preventing reentrancy attacks in Solidity smart contracts. It utilizes an unstructured storage pattern, allowing for compatibility with upgradeable contracts. However, there are several considerations that developers must keep in mind:

- **Proper Usage of Modifiers**: The effectiveness of the `nonReentrant` modifier relies heavily on its correct application. Developers must ensure that all state-changing functions are marked with this modifier to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities.

- **Storage Management**: The unstructured storage pattern, while beneficial for upgradeability, requires careful management to avoid conflicts. Developers should be aware of the implications of using specific storage slots and ensure that they do not inadvertently overwrite critical data.

- **Error Handling Clarity**: The custom error handling mechanism is efficient but requires proper documentation. Developers must understand the implications of the errors thrown and how to handle them in their implementations.

- **Gas Efficiency Considerations**: While the contract aims for gas optimization, the trade-offs between security and cost must be evaluated. Developers should consider the gas implications of their design choices and ensure that they align with the overall goals of the contract.

In conclusion, while the `UReentrancyGuard` contract provides a robust framework for preventing reentrancy attacks, it is crucial for developers to understand its limitations and best practices. Proper implementation and adherence to the guidelines provided in the contract documentation will help mitigate potential security vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the smart contracts that utilize this guard.

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Detailed Error Handling
```
The contract currently uses a single custom error for reentrancy checks. While this is sufficient for the specific case of reentrancy, it lacks detailed error messages that could provide more context in other potential failure scenarios. This can hinder debugging and understanding of issues during contract execution.

**Impact**: Limited error context can make it difficult for developers and users to diagnose issues, potentially leading to prolonged downtime or misuse of the contract.

**Mitigation**: Introduce additional custom errors for other failure scenarios, such as invalid state transitions or unauthorized access, and provide detailed messages for each error.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization with Status Variable
```
The contract uses `uint256` for the reentrancy status, which is more gas-expensive than using a `bool`. Since the status only needs to represent two states (entered or not entered), a `bool` would suffice.

**Impact**: Increased gas costs for deploying and executing functions that utilize the reentrancy guard.

**Mitigation**: Change the status variable from `uint256` to `bool`, which will reduce gas costs and simplify the logic.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Function Visibility
```
The functions `_status()` and `_setStatus()` are marked as private. This restricts their visibility to only the contract itself, which may not be necessary if these functions are intended to be used by derived contracts.

**Impact**: If derived contracts need to access the status directly, they will not be able to do so, leading to code duplication or unnecessary complexity.

**Mitigation**: Change the visibility of `_status()` and `_setStatus()` to `internal` to allow derived contracts to access these functions without compromising encapsulation.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Upgradeability Considerations
```
While the contract mentions compatibility with upgradeable contracts, there is no explicit versioning system or mechanism to handle upgrades safely.

**Impact**: Without a clear upgrade path, it may lead to issues when deploying new versions of the contract, potentially causing state inconsistencies or loss of data.

**Mitigation**: Implement a versioning system and consider using a proxy pattern (e.g., Transparent Proxy or UUPS) to facilitate safe upgrades while maintaining state.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Lack of Comprehensive Testing and Auditing
```
The contract does not mention any automated tests or formal verification processes. This is critical for ensuring the contract behaves as expected under various scenarios.

**Impact**: Without thorough testing, there is a higher risk of undetected bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Mitigation**: Establish a comprehensive testing framework that includes unit tests, integration tests, and formal verification methods to ensure the contract's functionality and security.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Insufficient Documentation
```
The current documentation is limited and does not provide enough context for users or developers to understand the contract's functionality fully.

**Impact**: Poor documentation can lead to misuse of the contract and difficulties in maintenance or further development.

**Mitigation**: Improve NatSpec comments throughout the contract to provide clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each function and modifier.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Additional Security Measures
```
The contract does not implement additional security patterns such as checks-effects-interactions or circuit breakers. These patterns help to mitigate risks associated with external calls and state changes.

**Impact**: Without these measures, the contract may be vulnerable to attacks that exploit external calls or state manipulation.

**Mitigation**: Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern in functions that interact with external contracts and consider adding circuit breakers to halt contract operations in case of detected anomalies.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `UReentrancyGuard` contract, here is a succinct summary of the security vulnerabilities identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: 
   - The contract is designed to prevent reentrant calls using the `nonReentrant` modifier. However, if a function marked as `nonReentrant` calls another `nonReentrant` function, it will fail. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.

2. **Storage Slot Manipulation**:
   - The contract uses an unstructured storage pattern for the reentrancy status. While this is intended to prevent storage collisions in upgradeable contracts, it introduces complexity and potential risks if the storage slot is manipulated incorrectly.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The contract uses a custom error `UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError` for reentrancy checks. While this is a good practice, it is crucial to ensure that all functions that could potentially trigger reentrancy checks are properly annotated and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Gas Optimization**:
   - The contract mentions that using booleans for the reentrancy status is more expensive than using `uint256`. While this is noted, the implementation does not provide a direct solution to optimize gas usage further, which could be a consideration for high-frequency function calls.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `UReentrancyGuard` contract is a well-structured implementation aimed at preventing reentrant calls, a common vulnerability in smart contracts. The use of an unstructured storage pattern is a thoughtful approach to ensure compatibility with upgradeable contracts. However, the complexity introduced by this pattern necessitates careful management to avoid potential storage conflicts.

The primary security concern lies in the handling of the `nonReentrant` modifier. While it effectively prevents reentrant calls, developers must be cautious when designing functions that interact with one another, as direct calls between `nonReentrant` functions will lead to failures. This could be mitigated by ensuring that such functions are designed to call private functions instead, thereby maintaining the integrity of the reentrancy guard.

Additionally, the reliance on custom error handling is commendable, but it requires thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases are covered. The contract's gas optimization considerations are also noteworthy, as they highlight the importance of efficient coding practices in Solidity.

In conclusion, while the `UReentrancyGuard` contract provides a robust mechanism for preventing reentrancy, developers must remain vigilant about the interactions between functions and the potential complexities introduced by the unstructured storage pattern. A comprehensive testing strategy and adherence to best practices will be essential to ensure the contract's security and efficiency.

[2024-22-08 09:40:47 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Based on the provided smart contract code for the `UReentrancyGuard` contract, here is a succinct summary of the security vulnerabilities identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: 
   - The contract is designed to prevent reentrant calls using the `nonReentrant` modifier. However, if a function marked as `nonReentrant` calls another `nonReentrant` function, it will fail. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.

2. **Storage Slot Manipulation**:
   - The contract uses an unstructured storage pattern for the reentrancy status. While this is intended to prevent storage collisions in upgradeable contracts, it introduces complexity and potential risks if the storage slot is manipulated incorrectly.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The contract uses a custom error `UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError` for reentrancy checks. While this is a good practice, it is crucial to ensure that all functions that could potentially trigger reentrancy checks are properly annotated and handle errors gracefully.

4. **Gas Optimization**:
   - The contract mentions that using booleans for the reentrancy status is more expensive than using `uint256`. While this is noted, the implementation does not provide a direct solution to optimize gas usage further, which could be a consideration for high-frequency function calls.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `UReentrancyGuard` contract is a well-structured implementation aimed at preventing reentrant calls, a common vulnerability in smart contracts. The use of an unstructured storage pattern is a thoughtful approach to ensure compatibility with upgradeable contracts. However, the complexity introduced by this pattern necessitates careful management to avoid potential storage conflicts.

The primary security concern lies in the handling of the `nonReentrant` modifier. While it effectively prevents reentrant calls, developers must be cautious when designing functions that interact with one another, as direct calls between `nonReentrant` functions will lead to failures. This could be mitigated by ensuring that such functions are designed to call private functions instead, thereby maintaining the integrity of the reentrancy guard.

Additionally, the reliance on custom error handling is commendable, but it requires thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases are covered. The contract's gas optimization considerations are also noteworthy, as they highlight the importance of efficient coding practices in Solidity.

In conclusion, while the `UReentrancyGuard` contract provides a robust mechanism for preventing reentrancy, developers must remain vigilant about the interactions between functions and the potential complexities introduced by the unstructured storage pattern. A comprehensive testing strategy and adherence to best practices will be essential to ensure the contract's security and efficiency.

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Reentrancy Risk in Non-Reentrant Functions**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract implements a non-reentrancy guard, but it is important to ensure that all functions that modify state and are marked with the `nonReentrant` modifier do not call each other directly. If two functions marked as `nonReentrant` call each other, it can lead to unexpected behavior or reentrancy attacks. The current implementation does mention this limitation, but it is crucial to enforce this rule strictly in the contract's design.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure that all public or external functions that are marked with the `nonReentrant` modifier do not directly call each other. Instead, consider using private functions for internal logic and exposing external functions that call these private functions. This will help maintain the integrity of the non-reentrancy guard.
```

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Potential Gas Limit Issues**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The use of assembly for reading and writing to the storage slot can lead to unexpected gas consumption patterns. If the contract is called in a context where gas limits are tight, it could potentially fail due to exceeding the gas limit, especially if the contract is complex or interacts with other contracts.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: While assembly can be efficient, it is advisable to use higher-level constructs whenever possible. Consider using standard Solidity functions for state changes unless there is a significant performance gain from using assembly. Additionally, ensure that the contract is tested under various gas conditions to identify any potential issues.
```

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Lack of Access Control on Initialization**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `UReentrancyGuard__initialize` function is internal, which means it can be called by any derived contract. If a derived contract does not properly control access to this function, it could lead to unintended initialization states or reinitialization of the guard, which could compromise the contract's security.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement access control mechanisms (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or similar patterns) to restrict who can call the `UReentrancyGuard__initialize` function. This will ensure that only authorized entities can initialize the contract.
```

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Error Handling and Custom Errors**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract uses a custom error for reentrancy, but it lacks detailed context about the failure. This can make debugging and understanding issues more difficult for developers and users interacting with the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Enhance the error handling by providing more context in the custom error messages. For instance, include information about the function being called or the state of the contract at the time of the error. This will improve the contract's usability and maintainability.
```

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Visibility of Internal Functions**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `_status()` and `_setStatus()` functions are marked as private, which restricts their visibility to the contract itself. While this is generally acceptable, it may limit the ability of derived contracts to utilize these functions if needed.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider changing the visibility of these functions to internal. This will allow derived contracts to access these functions while still preventing external contracts from calling them directly. This change can enhance the flexibility of the contract's design.
```

VULNERABILITY NAME: **Documentation and NatSpec Comments**
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: While the contract includes some documentation, the NatSpec comments could be more comprehensive. This can lead to misunderstandings about the contract's functionality and usage.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Improve the NatSpec documentation by providing detailed descriptions of each function, including parameters, return values, and potential errors. This will enhance the clarity of the contract and make it easier for developers to understand and use.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `UReentrancyGuard`, here is a succinct summary of the security vulnerabilities identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reentrancy Vulnerability**: 
   - The contract aims to prevent reentrant calls through the `nonReentrant` modifier. However, if a `nonReentrant` function calls another `nonReentrant` function, it will fail due to the restriction on nested calls. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed.

2. **Storage Slot Manipulation**:
   - The contract uses an unstructured storage pattern for the reentrancy status. While this is intended to prevent storage collisions in upgradeable contracts, it introduces complexity and potential risks if the storage slot is manipulated incorrectly.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The contract uses a custom error `UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError()` for handling reentrancy violations. While this is a good practice, it is essential to ensure that all functions that could potentially trigger reentrancy checks are adequately covered by this error handling.

4. **Gas Optimization**:
   - The contract mentions that using booleans for the reentrancy status is more expensive than using `uint256`. While this is a known gas optimization consideration, it is crucial to ensure that the chosen data type aligns with the contract's performance requirements.

5. **Initialization Function**:
   - The initialization function `UReentrancyGuard__initialize()` is marked as internal. If not called properly during contract deployment, the reentrancy status may not be set correctly, leading to vulnerabilities.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report:

The `UReentrancyGuard` contract is designed to mitigate reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in smart contracts. While it implements a robust mechanism to prevent such attacks, there are several areas of concern that need to be addressed:

- **Reentrancy Management**: The restriction on calling `nonReentrant` functions from one another can lead to complications in contract logic. Developers must be cautious in structuring their functions to avoid unintended failures.

- **Storage Complexity**: The use of an unstructured storage pattern is beneficial for upgradeable contracts but adds complexity. Developers should ensure that they understand the implications of this pattern and manage storage slots carefully to avoid conflicts.

- **Error Handling**: The contract's error handling is a positive aspect, but it is vital to ensure that all potential reentrancy scenarios are covered. Comprehensive testing should be conducted to validate that the error handling works as intended.

- **Gas Efficiency**: The choice of data types for status management should be reviewed to ensure that the contract remains gas-efficient while maintaining security.

- **Initialization Risks**: The internal initialization function must be called appropriately during contract deployment. A failure to do so could leave the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

In conclusion, while the `UReentrancyGuard` contract provides a solid foundation for preventing reentrancy attacks, careful attention must be paid to its implementation, particularly regarding function structuring, storage management, and initialization processes. A thorough audit and testing phase is recommended to ensure the contract's security and reliability in a production environment.

/**
 * @dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.
 *
 * Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier
 * available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
 * `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
 * points to them.
 *
 * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
 * to protect against it, check out our blog post
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul].
 *
 * NOTE: This contract has been extended from the Open Zeppelin library to include an
 *       unstructured storage pattern, so that it can be safely mixed in with upgradeable
 *       contracts without affecting their storage patterns through inheritance.
