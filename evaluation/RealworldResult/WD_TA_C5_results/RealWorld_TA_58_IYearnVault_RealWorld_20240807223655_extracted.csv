LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN DEPOSIT FUNCTION
'''
The `deposit` function allows users to deposit a specified amount of tokens into the vault. However, there is no validation to ensure that the `amount` parameter is greater than zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior if a user attempts to deposit zero tokens, which may not be the intended action. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the recipient address is not a zero address, which could lead to loss of funds.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Add a require statement to check that `amount` is greater than zero.
- Add a require statement to check that `recipient` is not a zero address.
'''

LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN WITHDRAW FUNCTION
'''
The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw shares from the vault. Similar to the `deposit` function, there is no validation to ensure that `maxShares` is greater than zero. This could allow a user to attempt to withdraw zero shares, which may not be the intended action. Furthermore, there is no check to ensure that the `recipient` address is not a zero address.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Add a require statement to check that `maxShares` is greater than zero.
- Add a require statement to check that `recipient` is not a zero address.

Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics. If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: "" DoS Vulnerability Identified.""
