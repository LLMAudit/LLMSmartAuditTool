VULNERABILITY NAME: Order of Inheritance Initialization
'''
The provided contract `MockUOwnable` inherits from `UOwnable`, and it calls the initialization function `super.UOwnable__initialize()` within its own `__initialize()` function. This raises concerns regarding the order of initialization, particularly if `UOwnable` has its own state variables that need to be initialized in a specific order. If `UOwnable` or any of its ancestors have constructors that require certain state variables to be set before others, failing to adhere to the expected initialization order can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

Recommended mitigation/fix:
1. Ensure that the initialization logic in `UOwnable` is properly sequenced and that all necessary state variables are initialized before they are used.
2. Consider using a constructor in `MockUOwnable` that directly calls the constructor of `UOwnable` if applicable, instead of relying on an external initialization function. This ensures that the initialization happens in the correct order as defined by Solidity's inheritance rules.
3. Review the entire inheritance chain for `UOwnable` to ensure that there are no ambiguities or conflicts arising from multiple inheritance, particularly if `UOwnable` inherits from other contracts.
