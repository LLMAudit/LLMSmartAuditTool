/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.

 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient

Let's analyze the provided `ERC20Snapshot` contract to identify potential improvements or enhancements.

1. **Access Control for Snapshots**: Currently, the `_snapshot` function is internal, which means it can be called by any derived contract. We could implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`) to restrict who can create snapshots. This would prevent malicious actors from creating snapshots at will.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The current implementation of storing snapshots in arrays could lead to high gas costs as the number of snapshots increases. We could consider using a more gas-efficient data structure, such as a mapping that stores only the necessary values, or a more compact representation of the snapshots.

3. **Snapshot Expiration**: Implementing a mechanism to limit the number of snapshots stored could help reduce gas costs and storage requirements. For example, we could allow only the last N snapshots to be kept, deleting older ones.

4. **Event Emission for Snapshot Creation**: While the contract emits a `Snapshot` event when a snapshot is created, it might be beneficial to include additional information in the event, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot. This could help in tracking changes over time without needing to call `totalSupplyAt`.

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The current error messages in the `require` statements are somewhat generic. We could enhance these messages to provide more context about the error, which would help in debugging.

6. **Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency**: The `_valueAt` function could be optimized further to reduce the number of array lookups. For instance, we could implement a binary search algorithm to find the snapshot more efficiently.

7. **Testing and Auditing**: While not a code change, ensuring that the contract is thoroughly tested and audited for edge cases, especially around snapshot creation and retrieval, is crucial for maintaining security.

8. **Documentation and Comments**: Improving the inline documentation and comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of each function could enhance maintainability and understanding for future developers.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?

Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.\nNote that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we\'ve collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with , followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. " Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".\n\nSecurity Analyst: Let\'s analyze the provided ERC20Snapshot contract to identify potential improvements or enhancements.\n1. Access Control for Snapshots: Currently, the _snapshot function is internal, which means it can be called by any derived contract. We could implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin\'s AccessControl) to restrict who can create snapshots. This would prevent malicious actors from creating snapshots at will.\n2. Gas Optimization: The current implementation of storing snapshots in arrays could lead to high gas costs as the number of snapshots increases. We could consider using a more gas-efficient data structure, such as a mapping that stores only the necessary values, or a more compact representation of the snapshots.\n3. Snapshot Expiration: Implementing a mechanism to limit the number of snapshots stored could help reduce gas costs and storage requirements. For example, we could allow only the last N snapshots to be kept, deleting older ones.\n4. Event Emission for Snapshot Creation: While the contract emits a Snapshot event when a snapshot is created, it might be beneficial to include additional information in the event, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot. This could help in tracking changes over time without needing to call totalSupplyAt.\n5. Enhanced Error Handling: The current error messages in the require statements are somewhat generic. We could enhance these messages to provide more context about the error, which would help in debugging.\n6. Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency: The _valueAt function could be optimized further to reduce the number of array lookups. For instance, we could implement a binary search algorithm to find the snapshot more efficiently.\n7. Testing and Auditing: While not a code change, ensuring that the contract is thoroughly tested and audited for edge cases, especially around snapshot creation and retrieval, is crucial for maintaining security.\n8. Documentation and Comments**: Improving the inline documentation and comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of each function could enhance maintainability and understanding for future developers.\nWhich of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?', 'question': 'Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs" '} |

[We are a specialized team that audits Solidity smart contracts using an advanced multi-agent system. Our approach combines the expertise of project management, smart contract counseling, auditing, and Solidity programming to deliver comprehensive and reliable contract assessments.
You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully analyze a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

As the Security Analyst, our primary objective is to brainstorm potential improvements or related ideas for this specific contract code. Engage with me in a focused discussion to ensure we deliver the most impactful suggestion to the user.
Note that our conversation should be centered exclusively on the provided Solidity contract code, AND output results must only be English. Once we've collectively refined our suggestions and achieved unanimous agreement, the discussion should be concluded by any participant with a response starting with <INFO>, followed directly by the final idea or enhancement suggestion, e.g. "<INFO> Implementing a multi-sig wallet mechanism for added security in transactions".

Security Analyst: Let's analyze the provided `ERC20Snapshot` contract to identify potential improvements or enhancements.
1. **Access Control for Snapshots**: Currently, the `_snapshot` function is internal, which means it can be called by any derived contract. We could implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`) to restrict who can create snapshots. This would prevent malicious actors from creating snapshots at will.
2. **Gas Optimization**: The current implementation of storing snapshots in arrays could lead to high gas costs as the number of snapshots increases. We could consider using a more gas-efficient data structure, such as a mapping that stores only the necessary values, or a more compact representation of the snapshots.
3. **Snapshot Expiration**: Implementing a mechanism to limit the number of snapshots stored could help reduce gas costs and storage requirements. For example, we could allow only the last N snapshots to be kept, deleting older ones.
4. **Event Emission for Snapshot Creation**: While the contract emits a `Snapshot` event when a snapshot is created, it might be beneficial to include additional information in the event, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot. This could help in tracking changes over time without needing to call `totalSupplyAt`.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The current error messages in the `require` statements are somewhat generic. We could enhance these messages to provide more context about the error, which would help in debugging.
6. **Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency**: The `_valueAt` function could be optimized further to reduce the number of array lookups. For instance, we could implement a binary search algorithm to find the snapshot more efficiently.
7. **Testing and Auditing**: While not a code change, ensuring that the contract is thoroughly tested and audited for edge cases, especially around snapshot creation and retrieval, is crucial for maintaining security.
8. **Documentation and Comments**: Improving the inline documentation and comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of each function could enhance maintainability and understanding for future developers.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

Ideas: " 1. **Access Control for Snapshots**: Implementing an access control mechanism to restrict who can create snapshots.
2. **Gas Optimization**: Using a more gas-efficient data structure for storing snapshots, such as a mapping.
3. **Snapshot Expiration**: Limiting the number of stored snapshots to reduce gas costs and storage requirements.
4. **Event Emission for Snapshot Creation**: Including additional information in the `Snapshot` event, such as total supply at the time of the snapshot.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improving error messages in `require` statements for better debugging.
6. **Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency**: Optimizing the `_valueAt` function with a binary search algorithm for faster retrieval.
7. **Testing and Auditing**: Ensuring thorough testing and auditing for edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval.
8. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing inline documentation and comments for better maintainability and understanding.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?".
As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control for Snapshots
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation allows any user to create a snapshot by calling the internal `_snapshot` function. This could lead to potential abuse, where malicious actors create excessive snapshots, increasing gas costs for all users and potentially targeting specific accounts to increase their transfer costs.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl) to restrict who can call the `_snapshot` function. This could be limited to specific roles, such as an admin or a governance contract.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation uses arrays to store snapshot ids and values, which can lead to high gas costs, especially as the number of snapshots increases. The retrieval of values from arrays is O(log n), which can become inefficient with a large number of snapshots.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider using a mapping structure to store snapshots, where the snapshot id maps directly to the balance or total supply. This would allow for O(1) retrieval and could significantly reduce gas costs.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Expiration
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not limit the number of stored snapshots, which can lead to increased gas costs and storage requirements over time. If too many snapshots are retained, it could also lead to performance degradation.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of stored snapshots, such as removing the oldest snapshot when a new one is created after reaching a predefined limit.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Event Emission for Snapshot Creation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `Snapshot` event currently only emits the snapshot id. This limits the information available for off-chain analysis and could hinder debugging efforts.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Enhance the `Snapshot` event to include additional information, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot, to provide more context for each snapshot created.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Enhanced Error Handling
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The error messages in the `require` statements are generic and may not provide sufficient context for debugging. This can make it difficult to identify the cause of errors during contract execution.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Improve the error messages in the `require` statements to include more specific information about the failure, such as the snapshot id or account address involved in the error.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `_valueAt` function uses a linear search approach to find the appropriate snapshot value, which can be inefficient as the number of snapshots increases.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Optimize the `_valueAt` function to implement a binary search algorithm for faster retrieval of snapshot values, which would improve efficiency significantly.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Testing and Auditing
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not mention any specific testing or auditing measures for edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval. This could lead to untested scenarios that may introduce vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Ensure thorough testing and auditing of the contract, focusing on edge cases such as snapshot creation during transfers, querying non-existent snapshots, and the behavior of the contract under various conditions.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Documentation and Comments
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: While the contract has some documentation, it may not be sufficient for future developers or auditors to understand the intricacies of the snapshot mechanism and its implications.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Enhance inline documentation and comments throughout the contract to provide better context and understanding of the code, especially for complex functions and logic.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities in the ERC20Snapshot Contract

1. **Snapshot Exposure**: The `_snapshot` function is marked as `internal`, which means it can be called by derived contracts. If not properly controlled, this could lead to unauthorized snapshot creation, potentially allowing malicious actors to manipulate snapshot data for their benefit.

2. **Gas Cost Concerns**: The contract mentions that while snapshot creation is efficient, the retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot incurs a logarithmic gas cost. This could lead to increased transaction costs for users, especially if snapshots are created frequently or if many snapshots exist.

3. **Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)**: If an attacker can manipulate the snapshot creation process, they could potentially increase the gas costs for specific accounts, leading to a denial of service for those accounts during token transfers.

4. **Non-monotonic Snapshot IDs**: The contract warns about the importance of maintaining monotonicity in snapshot IDs. If a derived contract overrides the `_getCurrentSnapshotId` method incorrectly, it could lead to non-monotonic IDs, breaking the snapshot mechanism and causing inconsistencies in balance retrieval.

5. **Lack of Access Control**: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms (e.g., using `AccessControl` from OpenZeppelin) to restrict who can create snapshots. This could lead to misuse by unauthorized users.

6. **Snapshot Data Integrity**: The contract relies on the integrity of the data stored in snapshots. If there are bugs in the logic that updates snapshots, it could lead to incorrect balance or supply data being returned, which could be exploited.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The ERC20Snapshot contract provides a mechanism for creating snapshots of token balances and total supply, which can be beneficial for implementing features like dividends or weighted voting. However, several security vulnerabilities have been identified that could compromise the integrity and usability of the contract:

- **Unauthorized Access**: The lack of access control on the snapshot creation function poses a significant risk. It is crucial to implement proper access restrictions to ensure that only authorized entities can create snapshots.

- **Gas Efficiency**: While the contract is designed to be efficient, the potential for increased gas costs during balance retrieval could deter users from utilizing the snapshot features. This should be addressed by optimizing the snapshot retrieval process or providing clear guidelines on usage.

- **Denial of Service Risks**: The possibility of an attacker manipulating snapshot creation to increase costs for specific accounts could lead to a denial of service. This risk necessitates careful consideration of how snapshots are managed and accessed.

- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: The reliance on correct implementation of snapshot updates is critical. Any bugs in this logic could lead to incorrect data being returned, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

In conclusion, while the ERC20Snapshot contract introduces valuable functionality, it is essential to address the identified vulnerabilities to ensure the security and reliability of the contract. Implementing access controls, optimizing gas usage, and ensuring data integrity will be key steps in enhancing the contract's robustness against potential attacks.

This could lead to increased transaction costs for users, especially if snapshots are created frequently or if many snapshots exist.

3. **Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)**: If an attacker can manipulate the snapshot creation process, they could potentially increase the gas costs for specific accounts, leading to a denial of service for those accounts during token transfers.

4. **Non-monotonic Snapshot IDs**: The contract warns about the importance of maintaining monotonicity in snapshot IDs. If a derived contract overrides the `_getCurrentSnapshotId` method incorrectly, it could lead to non-monotonic IDs, breaking the snapshot mechanism and causing inconsistencies in balance retrieval.

5. **Lack of Access Control**: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms (e.g., using `AccessControl` from OpenZeppelin) to restrict who can create snapshots. This could lead to misuse by unauthorized users.

6. **Snapshot Data Integrity**: The contract relies on the integrity of the data stored in snapshots. If there are bugs in the logic that updates snapshots, it could lead to incorrect balance or supply data being returned, which could be exploited.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The ERC20Snapshot contract provides a mechanism for creating snapshots of token balances and total supply, which can be beneficial for implementing features like dividends or weighted voting. However, several security vulnerabilities have been identified that could compromise the integrity and usability of the contract:

- **Unauthorized Access**: The lack of access control on the snapshot creation function poses a significant risk. It is crucial to implement proper access restrictions to ensure that only authorized entities can create snapshots.

- **Gas Efficiency**: While the contract is designed to be efficient, the potential for increased gas costs during balance retrieval could deter users from utilizing the snapshot features. This should be addressed by optimizing the snapshot retrieval process or providing clear guidelines on usage.

- **Denial of Service Risks**: The possibility of an attacker manipulating snapshot creation to increase costs for specific accounts could lead to a denial of service. This risk necessitates careful consideration of how snapshots are managed and accessed.

- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: The reliance on correct implementation of snapshot updates is critical. Any bugs in this logic could lead to incorrect data being returned, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

In conclusion, while the ERC20Snapshot contract introduces valuable functionality, it is essential to address the identified vulnerabilities to ensure the security and reliability of the contract. Implementing access controls, optimizing gas usage, and ensuring data integrity will be key steps in enhancing the contract's robustness against potential attacks.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

Ideas: " 1. **Access Control for Snapshots**: Implementing an access control mechanism to restrict who can create snapshots.
2. **Gas Optimization**: Using a more gas-efficient data structure for storing snapshots, such as a mapping.
3. **Snapshot Expiration**: Limiting the number of stored snapshots to reduce gas costs and storage requirements.
4. **Event Emission for Snapshot Creation**: Including additional information in the `Snapshot` event, such as total supply at the time of the snapshot.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improving error messages in `require` statements for better debugging.
6. **Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency**: Optimizing the `_valueAt` function with a binary search algorithm for faster retrieval.
7. **Testing and Auditing**: Ensuring thorough testing and auditing for edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval.
8. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing inline documentation and comments for better maintainability and understanding.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?".
As the Security Analyst, your chief priority is to thoroughly inspect the given contract code and identify all potential vulnerabilities. It's crucial to ensure the contract's security and operability.
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation or fix.
```
Note that we must concentrate exclusively on identifying, describing, and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities within the contract code. Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed, indicate the completion of your analysis by responding with: "<INFO> Analysis Complete."

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

     * set of accounts, for example using {AccessControl}, or it may be open to the public.
     *
     * [WARNING]
     * ====
     * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
     * you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.
     *
     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
     * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
     * section above.

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control for Snapshots
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation allows any user to call the `_snapshot` function, which can lead to abuse. An attacker could create excessive snapshots, increasing gas costs for all users and potentially targeting specific accounts to increase their transfer costs. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl) to restrict who can create snapshots. Only authorized accounts should be able to call the `_snapshot` function.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation uses arrays to store snapshot ids and values, which can lead to high gas costs, especially as the number of snapshots increases. The retrieval of values from arrays is O(log n), which can become inefficient with a large number of snapshots.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider using a more gas-efficient data structure, such as a mapping that associates snapshot ids with their corresponding values. This would allow for O(1) retrieval of values and reduce gas costs.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Expiration
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not limit the number of stored snapshots, which can lead to increased gas costs and storage requirements over time. If too many snapshots are created, it may become impractical to manage them.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of stored snapshots, such as removing the oldest snapshot when a new one is created after reaching a predefined limit. This would help manage storage costs and maintain efficiency.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Enhanced Error Handling
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The error messages in the `require` statements are generic and may not provide sufficient context for debugging. This can make it difficult for developers to identify the cause of errors when interacting with the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Improve error messages in `require` statements to include more context about the failure. For example, specify which snapshot id was invalid or which account was involved in the error.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `_valueAt` function uses a linear search to find the appropriate snapshot value, which can be inefficient as the number of snapshots increases. This can lead to increased gas costs and slower retrieval times.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Optimize the `_valueAt` function using a binary search algorithm to improve retrieval efficiency. This would significantly reduce the time complexity for finding snapshot values.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Event Emission for Snapshot Creation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `Snapshot` event currently only emits the snapshot id. This limits the information available for tracking and auditing purposes, making it harder to understand the state of the contract at the time of the snapshot.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Include additional information in the `Snapshot` event, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot. This would provide more context and improve transparency for users and auditors.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Testing and Auditing
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract lacks thorough testing and auditing for edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval. Without comprehensive tests, there is a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases for snapshot creation and retrieval. Additionally, consider a third-party audit to ensure the contract's security and reliability.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Documentation and Comments
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The inline documentation and comments in the contract could be enhanced for better maintainability and understanding. Insufficient documentation can lead to misunderstandings and errors during future development or audits.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Improve the inline documentation and comments throughout the contract to provide clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each function and variable. This will aid future developers in understanding the codebase.

Based on the provided smart contract code for the `ERC20Snapshot` contract, here is a summary of potential security vulnerabilities and concerns identified within the code:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Snapshot Function Exposure**:
   - The `_snapshot` function is marked as `internal`, which means it can be called by derived contracts. If not properly controlled, this could allow malicious actors to create snapshots at will, potentially leading to denial of service for other users by increasing the cost of retrieval from snapshots.

2. **Gas Cost Concerns**:
   - The contract notes that creating snapshots incurs a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers. If an attacker can manipulate the snapshot creation frequency, they could increase the gas costs for specific accounts, leading to a denial of service.

3. **Non-monotonic Snapshot IDs**:
   - The contract warns that overriding the `_getCurrentSnapshotId` method to return non-monotonic values could break the contract. If a derived contract does not maintain monotonicity, it could lead to incorrect snapshot retrievals and potential exploits.

4. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms (e.g., using `AccessControl` from OpenZeppelin) to restrict who can create snapshots. This could lead to abuse by unauthorized users.

5. **Potential for Double Spending**:
   - While the contract aims to prevent double spending through snapshots, if the snapshot mechanism is not properly managed, there could still be scenarios where balances are incorrectly reported, especially if multiple snapshots are created in quick succession.

6. **Snapshot Retrieval Logic**:
   - The `_valueAt` function relies on finding the upper bound of snapshot IDs. If there are many snapshots, this could lead to inefficiencies in gas usage during retrieval, especially if not optimized.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `ERC20Snapshot` contract provides a mechanism to create snapshots of token balances and total supply, which can be beneficial for implementing features like dividends or weighted voting. However, several security vulnerabilities and concerns need to be addressed to ensure the contract's robustness and reliability:

1. **Control Over Snapshot Creation**: It is crucial to implement access control to restrict who can create snapshots. This will help mitigate the risk of denial of service attacks and ensure that only authorized entities can trigger snapshot creation.

2. **Gas Efficiency**: The potential for increased gas costs during transfers due to snapshot bookkeeping should be carefully considered. Optimizing the snapshot retrieval process and minimizing the frequency of snapshot creation can help alleviate this issue.

3. **Monotonicity of Snapshot IDs**: Developers extending this contract must ensure that any overridden methods maintain the monotonicity of snapshot IDs to prevent breaking the snapshot retrieval logic.

4. **Testing and Auditing**: Comprehensive testing and auditing of the snapshot mechanism are essential to identify edge cases that could lead to incorrect balance reporting or snapshot retrieval failures.

5. **Documentation and Warnings**: Clear documentation regarding the risks associated with snapshot creation and retrieval should be provided to developers using this contract, ensuring they understand the implications of their implementations.

In conclusion, while the `ERC20Snapshot` contract offers valuable functionality, it is imperative to address the identified vulnerabilities and concerns to ensure secure and efficient operation. Implementing access control, optimizing gas usage, and maintaining clear documentation will contribute to a more robust smart contract.

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Snapshot Function Exposure**:
   - The `_snapshot` function is marked as `internal`, which means it can be called by derived contracts. If not properly controlled, this could allow malicious actors to create snapshots at will, potentially leading to denial of service for other users by increasing the cost of retrieval from snapshots.

2. **Gas Cost Concerns**:
   - The contract notes that creating snapshots incurs a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers. If an attacker can manipulate the snapshot creation frequency, they could increase the gas costs for specific accounts, leading to a denial of service.

Ideas: " 1. **Access Control for Snapshots**: Implementing an access control mechanism to restrict who can create snapshots.
2. **Gas Optimization**: Using a more gas-efficient data structure for storing snapshots, such as a mapping.
3. **Snapshot Expiration**: Limiting the number of stored snapshots to reduce gas costs and storage requirements.
4. **Event Emission for Snapshot Creation**: Including additional information in the `Snapshot` event, such as total supply at the time of the snapshot.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improving error messages in `require` statements for better debugging.
6. **Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency**: Optimizing the `_valueAt` function with a binary search algorithm for faster retrieval.
7. **Testing and Auditing**: Ensuring thorough testing and auditing for edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval.
8. **Documentation and Comments**: Enhancing inline documentation and comments for better maintainability and understanding.

Which of these suggestions resonates most with you, or do you have any additional ideas to consider?".

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

     * set of accounts, for example using {AccessControl}, or it may be open to the public.
     *
     * [WARNING]
     * ====
     * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
     * you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.
     *
     * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
     * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target

### VULNERABILITY: Access Control for Snapshots
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation allows any user to create a snapshot by calling the internal `_snapshot` function. This can lead to abuse where malicious actors create excessive snapshots, increasing gas costs for all users and potentially targeting specific accounts to increase their transaction costs. 

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement an access control mechanism (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl) to restrict who can call the `_snapshot` function. This could be limited to only certain roles, such as an admin or governance contract.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Gas Optimization
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The current implementation uses arrays to store snapshot ids and values, which can lead to increased gas costs as the number of snapshots grows. The retrieval of values from these arrays is O(log n), which can become inefficient with a large number of snapshots.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Consider using a mapping structure to store snapshots, where the snapshot id maps directly to the value. This would allow for O(1) retrieval and could significantly reduce gas costs.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Expiration
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not limit the number of stored snapshots, which can lead to high storage costs and increased gas fees over time. If too many snapshots are created, it can also affect the performance of the contract.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Implement a mechanism to limit the number of stored snapshots, such as removing the oldest snapshot when a new one is created after reaching a predefined limit.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Event Emission for Snapshot Creation
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `Snapshot` event currently only emits the snapshot id. This limits the information available for off-chain analysis and monitoring. 

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Enhance the `Snapshot` event to include additional information, such as the total supply at the time of the snapshot, to provide more context for users and developers.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Enhanced Error Handling
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The error messages in the `require` statements are generic and may not provide enough context for debugging. This can make it difficult for developers to identify the root cause of issues when they arise.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Improve the error messages in the `require` statements to include more specific information about the failure, such as the snapshot id that caused the error or the account involved.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Snapshot Retrieval Efficiency
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `_valueAt` function uses a linear search method to find the appropriate snapshot value, which can be inefficient as the number of snapshots increases. 

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Optimize the `_valueAt` function using a binary search algorithm to improve retrieval efficiency, especially for contracts that expect a high number of snapshots.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Testing and Auditing
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract does not mention any specific testing or auditing procedures, which raises concerns about the reliability of the implementation. Without thorough testing, edge cases related to snapshot creation and retrieval may not be handled properly.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Establish a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and audits focusing on edge cases related to snapshot functionality. This should also include testing for gas costs and performance under various scenarios.
```

### VULNERABILITY: Documentation and Comments
```
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: While the contract has some documentation, it could be enhanced for better maintainability and understanding. Lack of clear documentation can lead to misunderstandings about how the contract operates and its intended use.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Enhance inline documentation and comments throughout the contract to clarify the purpose and functionality of each function and variable, making it easier for future developers to understand and maintain the code.

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract code for the `ERC20Snapshot` contract, here is a summary of the potential security vulnerabilities identified:

### Summary of Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Snapshot Function Accessibility**:
   - The `_snapshot` function is marked as `internal`, which means it can be called by derived contracts. If not properly controlled, this could allow malicious contracts to create snapshots at will, potentially leading to denial of service for other users by increasing the cost of retrieving snapshot data.

2. **Gas Cost Implications**:
   - The contract mentions that while the snapshot creation is efficient (_O(1)_), the retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_. If many snapshots are created, this could lead to increased gas costs for users querying historical data, particularly if the `_snapshot` function is misused.

3. **Non-monotonic Snapshot IDs**:
   - The contract warns about the importance of maintaining monotonicity in snapshot IDs. If a derived contract overrides the `_getCurrentSnapshotId` method incorrectly, it could lead to non-monotonic IDs, breaking the functionality of the snapshot mechanism.

4. **Potential for Double Spending**:
   - Although the contract aims to prevent double spending through snapshots, if the snapshot mechanism is not implemented correctly in derived contracts, it could still be possible for users to exploit the system by manipulating their balances before a snapshot is taken.

5. **Lack of Access Control**:
   - The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms (e.g., using `AccessControl` or `Ownable`) to restrict who can create snapshots. This could lead to unauthorized users creating snapshots, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.

6. **Snapshot Data Integrity**:
   - The integrity of the snapshot data relies on the proper implementation of the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook. If this hook is not correctly overridden in derived contracts, it could lead to inconsistencies in the snapshot data.

### Comprehensive Analysis Report

The `ERC20Snapshot` contract provides a mechanism for creating snapshots of token balances and total supply, which is useful for various applications such as dividends and voting. However, several security vulnerabilities could compromise the integrity and usability of the contract:

- **Access Control**: The lack of access control on the snapshot creation function poses a significant risk. It is crucial to implement proper access restrictions to ensure that only authorized entities can create snapshots.

- **Gas Efficiency**: While the snapshot mechanism is designed to be efficient, the potential for increased gas costs during data retrieval must be carefully managed. Developers should consider the implications of frequent snapshot creation and implement strategies to mitigate gas costs for users.

- **Snapshot ID Management**: The contract's reliance on monotonic snapshot IDs is critical. Any derived contracts must ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce non-monotonic behavior, which could disrupt the snapshot functionality.

- **Data Integrity**: The integrity of snapshot data is paramount. Developers must ensure that the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook is correctly implemented to maintain accurate records of balances and total supply.

In conclusion, while the `ERC20Snapshot` contract offers valuable functionality, it is essential to address the identified vulnerabilities through careful design, implementation of access controls, and thorough testing. By doing so, the contract can achieve a higher level of security and reliability for its users.

 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
