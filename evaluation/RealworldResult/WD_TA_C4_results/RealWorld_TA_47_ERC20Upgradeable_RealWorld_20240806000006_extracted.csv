**VULNERABILITY NAME: Zero Address Validation in Transfer Functions**
'''
The contract does not adequately validate the `recipient` address in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Although there is a check to ensure that the `recipient` is not the zero address, the `sender` address in the `transfer` function and the `sender` and `recipient` addresses in the `transferFrom` function are not checked for validity before proceeding with the transfer. This could lead to unexpected behavior if a user accidentally or maliciously tries to transfer tokens to the zero address, resulting in a loss of tokens.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Add a check to ensure that the `sender` address is not the zero address in the `transfer` function and that both `sender` and `recipient` addresses are not the zero address in the `transferFrom` function. This will prevent transfers to or from the zero address, which is a common best practice in ERC20 token implementations.
'''

**VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation on Amounts in Transfer Functions**
'''
The contract does not validate the `amount` parameter in the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `_mint`, and `_burn` functions. If a user attempts to transfer a negative amount or an amount that exceeds their balance (in the case of `transfer` and `transferFrom`), the contract will revert, but it does not explicitly check for zero or negative amounts before performing operations. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Implement checks to ensure that the `amount` is greater than zero before proceeding with the transfer or minting operations. This will help prevent any unintended consequences from invalid amounts being processed.
'''

**VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation on Allowance in Approve Function**
'''
The `approve` function does not validate the `amount` parameter. If a user sets an allowance to a negative value (which would not be possible due to the `uint256` type), it could still lead to confusion or unintended behavior if the user mistakenly sets it to zero or an excessively high value.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Add a check to ensure that the `amount` is greater than zero before allowing the approval. This will help prevent users from accidentally approving zero or negative allowances, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.
'''

**VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation in Increase and Decrease Allowance Functions**
'''
The `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions do not validate the `addedValue` and `subtractedValue` parameters. If a user tries to increase or decrease the allowance by a negative value or a value that exceeds the current allowance, it could lead to unexpected behavior or confusion.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix:**
Implement checks to ensure that `addedValue` is greater than zero in `increaseAllowance` and that `subtractedValue` is greater than zero and does not exceed the current allowance in `decreaseAllowance`. This will help prevent invalid operations on allowances.

| **phase_prompt** | Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided: Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."". Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."". As the {assistant_role}, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases: 1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion. 2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas. 3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures. 4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block. Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information: 1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion. 2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures. 3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS. 4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics. If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: "" DoS Vulnerability Identified."" For each vulnerability identified, use the following format: VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE ''' DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, along with recommended mitigation measures or fixes that do not require code upgrades. ''' If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "" No DoS Vulnerabilities."" |

Although there is a check to ensure that the recipient is not the zero address, the sender address in the transfer function and the sender and recipient addresses in the transferFrom function are not checked for validity before proceeding with the transfer. This could lead to unexpected behavior if a user accidentally or maliciously tries to transfer tokens to the zero address, resulting in a loss of tokens.\n\nRecommended Mitigation/Fix:\nAdd a check to ensure that the sender address is not the zero address in the transfer function and that both sender and recipient addresses are not the zero address in the transferFrom function. This will prevent transfers to or from the zero address, which is a common best practice in ERC20 token implementations.\n'''\n\nVULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation on Amounts in Transfer Functions\n'''\nThe contract does not validate the amount parameter in the transfer, transferFrom, _mint, and _burn functions. If a user attempts to transfer a negative amount or an amount that exceeds their balance (in the case of transfer and transferFrom), the contract will revert, but it does not explicitly check for zero or negative amounts before performing operations. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior.\n\nRecommended Mitigation/Fix:\nImplement checks to ensure that the amount is greater than zero before proceeding with the transfer or minting operations. This will help prevent any unintended consequences from invalid amounts being processed.\n'''\n\nVULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation on Allowance in Approve Function\n'''\nThe approve function does not validate the amount parameter. If a user sets an allowance to a negative value (which would not be possible due to the uint256 type), it could still lead to confusion or unintended behavior if the user mistakenly sets it to zero or an excessively high value.\n\nRecommended Mitigation/Fix:\nAdd a check to ensure that the amount is greater than zero before allowing the approval. This will help prevent users from accidentally approving zero or negative allowances, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.\n'''\n\nVULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Validation in Increase and Decrease Allowance Functions\n'''\nThe increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions do not validate the addedValue and subtractedValue parameters. If a user tries to increase or decrease the allowance by a negative value or a value that exceeds the current allowance, it could lead to unexpected behavior or confusion.\n\nRecommended Mitigation/Fix:\nImplement checks to ensure that addedValue is greater than zero in increaseAllowance and that subtractedValue is greater than zero and does not exceed the current allowance in decreaseAllowance. This will help prevent invalid operations on allowances.\n'''""} |

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

To complete the task,  you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."".
Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: """,
