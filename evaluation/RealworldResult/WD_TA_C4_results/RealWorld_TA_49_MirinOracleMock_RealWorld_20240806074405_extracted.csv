,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Gas Limit Identified.

**Lack of Gas Limit Considerations**
'''
The `addPricePoints` function iterates over the input arrays and pushes new `PricePoint` structs into the `pricePoints` array. If the input arrays are large, this could lead to a situation where the function consumes all available gas, resulting in an out-of-gas error. This is particularly concerning if a user attempts to add a large number of price points in a single transaction, which could lead to failed transactions and a poor user experience.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a batching mechanism that allows users to add a limited number of price points per transaction. This can be achieved by splitting the input arrays into smaller chunks and processing them in multiple transactions. Additionally, you could implement a maximum limit on the number of price points that can be added in a single call.

'''


[2024-06-08 07:44:35 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ","<INFO> Price Manipulation Identified.

```
LACK OF PRICE VALIDATION
'''
The contract allows the addition of price points through the `addPricePoints` function without any validation or checks on the price values being added. This means that a centralized authority or malicious actor could potentially add arbitrary price points, leading to price manipulation. If the price points are not derived from a reliable source or if they are manipulated, it could result in unfair trades and exploitation of users relying on this data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a validation mechanism that checks the authenticity and accuracy of the price data before allowing it to be added to the `pricePoints` array. This could involve integrating with a trusted oracle service or requiring that price points be submitted by a verified source.
'''

```

```
LACK OF DECENTRALIZED PRICE ORACLE
'''
The contract does not utilize a decentralized or transparent mechanism for determining token prices, which could allow a controlling entity to manipulate prices at will. The current implementation relies on the input provided by the user, which can be arbitrary and unverified. This lack of decentralization can lead to exploitation by the controlling entity, as they can submit inflated or deflated prices to benefit their trades.

To address this issue, it is advisable to integrate a decentralized price oracle that provides reliable and tamper-proof price data. This would ensure that the prices used in the contract are based on real market conditions and are less susceptible to manipulation by any single party.

 ",,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.
```

[2024-06-08 07:44:50 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Upon thorough inspection of the provided `MirinOracleMock` contract code, I have conducted the following analysis regarding the presence of a withdrawal function and its security implications:

1. **Scrutiny of Contract Code**: The contract does not contain any functions that allow users to withdraw their deposited funds. The primary functionality revolves around storing price points and does not involve handling Ether or other assets in a way that would necessitate a withdrawal mechanism.

2. **Scanning for Withdrawal Functions**: There are no functions related to withdrawing Ether or other assets present in the contract. The functions defined (`token0`, `token1`, `addPricePoints`, and `pricePointsLength`) do not facilitate any form of asset withdrawal.

3. **Evaluation of Withdrawal Functionality**: Since no withdrawal function exists, there is no logic to evaluate for security best practices, such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or protection against reentrancy attacks.

4. **Impact Assessment**: The absence of a withdrawal function means that users who may have deposited funds (if any were intended to be deposited) into the contract have no way to retrieve those funds. This poses a significant risk, as users could potentially lose access to their assets indefinitely. It is crucial for any contract that handles user funds to implement a secure withdrawal mechanism to ensure users can retrieve their assets safely.

Given the findings above, I conclude with the following:

```
",,"<INFO> Potential Data Inconsistency Identified.
```
POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract `MirinOracleMock` does not enforce any checks on the timestamps being added in the `addPricePoints` function. This could lead to inconsistent data being stored in the `pricePoints` array. For example, if a user adds price points with timestamps that are not in chronological order, it could lead to confusion when retrieving price data later, as the assumption might be that the data is ordered by timestamp.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a check that ensures the timestamps are in ascending order before adding them to the `pricePoints` array. This can be done by comparing each timestamp with the previous one during the loop that adds the price points.

Example implementation:
```solidity
function addPricePoints(
    uint256[] memory _timestamps,
    uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
    uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
) public onlyOwner {
    require(_timestamps.length == _price0Cumulatives.length && _price0Cumulatives.length == _price1Cumulatives.length, ""price point arrays must have same length"");
    
    uint256 lastTimestamp = 0; // Initialize to zero or a suitable minimum value
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _timestamps.length; i++) {
        require(_timestamps[i] > lastTimestamp, ""Timestamps must be in ascending order"");
        lastTimestamp = _timestamps[i]; // Update lastTimestamp to the current one
        pricePoints.push(PricePoint(
            _timestamps[i],
            _price0Cumulatives[i],
            _price1Cumulatives[i]
        ));
    }
}

 ",,,,"<INFO> Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier Identified.

VULNERABILITY NAME: Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier
'''
The `addPricePoints` function in the `MirinOracleMock` contract is publicly accessible, meaning that any user can call this function and add price points to the `pricePoints` array. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the price data, which is critical for the integrity of the oracle's functionality. An attacker could potentially manipulate the price points, leading to incorrect pricing information being used by other contracts that rely on this oracle.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier, to restrict access to the `addPricePoints` function. This would ensure that only the contract owner can add price points, thereby maintaining the integrity of the data.

Example of implementation:
```solidity
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"";

contract MirinOracleMock is IMirinOracle, Ownable {
    ...
    function addPricePoints(
        uint256[] memory _timestamps,
        uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
        uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
    ) public onlyOwner {

 ",,,,"<INFO> External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**VULNERABILITY: Dependence on a Single External Oracle**
'''
The contract relies on an external oracle for price data, which can lead to significant risks if the oracle is compromised or provides incorrect data. If the oracle fails or is manipulated, the integrity of the price points stored in the contract could be jeopardized, leading to potential financial losses or exploitation. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement a multi-oracle approach where data is aggregated from multiple oracles to enhance reliability. Additionally, incorporating a mechanism to validate the data received from the oracle before it is used in critical functions can further safeguard against erroneous data.
'''

**VULNERABILITY: Lack of Fallback Mechanisms**
'''
The contract does not include any fallback mechanisms to handle scenarios where the oracle call fails or returns invalid data. This absence can lead to contract failure, rendering it unusable in critical situations. To address this issue, it is advisable to implement error handling and fallback functions that can gracefully manage failures. For instance, the contract could revert transactions if the oracle data is not valid or provide a default value to ensure that the contract remains operational even in the event of an oracle failure.

LACK OF ACCESS CONTROL
'''
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, which means that any user can call the `addPricePoints` function. This could lead to a situation where a malicious actor could add arbitrary price points, potentially manipulating the data stored in the contract. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism, such as using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl contracts, to restrict the execution of critical functions like `addPricePoints` to authorized addresses only.

 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN addPricePoints FUNCTION
'''
The addPricePoints function does not validate the values of the timestamps, price0Cumulatives, and price1Cumulatives being added to the pricePoints array. This can lead to several issues:
1. Timestamps could be in the past or future, which may not be appropriate for the intended use of the price points.
2. Price values could be negative or excessively large, which may cause overflow issues or logical errors in future calculations.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Validate that timestamps are not in the past (i.e., they should be greater than or equal to the current block timestamp).
- Ensure that price0Cumulatives and price1Cumulatives are non-negative and within a reasonable range.
- Implement checks to prevent duplicate timestamps if that is a requirement for the logic of the contract.

[2024-06-08 07:45:56 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 ","<INFO> DoS Vulnerability Identified.

**UNBOUNDED LOOP VULNERABILITY**
'''
The `addPricePoints` function contains a loop that iterates over the length of the input arrays. If an attacker provides excessively large arrays as input, this could lead to gas exhaustion, causing the transaction to fail. Since there is no upper limit enforced on the size of the arrays, this presents a risk of Denial of Service (DoS) by making the contract unable to process legitimate transactions.

**Mitigation Measures:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can implement a maximum limit on the number of price points that can be added in a single transaction. For example, you could add a require statement at the beginning of the `addPricePoints` function to check that the length of the input arrays does not exceed a predefined constant, such as 100 or 200.
'''

**EXTERNAL CALL VULNERABILITY**
'''
While the current implementation does not make any external calls, if future modifications introduce external calls (e.g., to other contracts or oracles), there is a risk that these calls could fail or consume excessive gas. If an external call fails, it could lead to a situation where the contract is unable to perform its intended functions, resulting in a DoS condition.

**Mitigation Measures:**
To prevent this, ensure that any future external calls are handled with proper error handling, such as using `try/catch` for external contract calls or checking return values. Additionally, consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to minimize risks associated with external calls.

Ideas: "" Gas Limit Identified.

**Lack of Gas Limit Considerations**
'''
The `addPricePoints` function iterates over the input arrays and pushes new `PricePoint` structs into the `pricePoints` array. If the input arrays are large, this could lead to a situation where the function consumes all available gas, resulting in an out-of-gas error. This is particularly concerning if a user attempts to add a large number of price points in a single transaction, which could lead to failed transactions and a poor user experience.

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a batching mechanism that allows users to add a limited number of price points per transaction. This can be achieved by splitting the input arrays into smaller chunks and processing them in multiple transactions. Additionally, you could implement a maximum limit on the number of price points that can be added in a single call.

'''
"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Price Manipulation. There are two cases where the contract may have Price Manipulation vulnerabilities:
1. When the contract allows arbitrary adjustment of token prices by a centralized authority without any checks or balances, potentially leading to unfair trades.
2. When the contract does not utilize decentralized or transparent mechanisms for determining token prices, allowing for potential exploitation by the controlling entity.
If you identify all Price Manipulation vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> Price Manipulation Identified.

```
LACK OF PRICE VALIDATION
'''
The contract allows the addition of price points through the `addPricePoints` function without any validation or checks on the price values being added. This means that a centralized authority or malicious actor could potentially add arbitrary price points, leading to price manipulation. If the price points are not derived from a reliable source or if they are manipulated, it could result in unfair trades and exploitation of users relying on this data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a validation mechanism that checks the authenticity and accuracy of the price data before allowing it to be added to the `pricePoints` array. This could involve integrating with a trusted oracle service or requiring that price points be submitted by a verified source.
'''

```

```
LACK OF DECENTRALIZED PRICE ORACLE
'''
The contract does not utilize a decentralized or transparent mechanism for determining token prices, which could allow a controlling entity to manipulate prices at will. The current implementation relies on the input provided by the user, which can be arbitrary and unverified. This lack of decentralization can lead to exploitation by the controlling entity, as they can submit inflated or deflated prices to benefit their trades.

To address this issue, it is advisable to integrate a decentralized price oracle that provides reliable and tamper-proof price data. This would ensure that the prices used in the contract are based on real market conditions and are less susceptible to manipulation by any single party.

LACK OF PRICE VALIDATION
'''
The contract allows the addition of price points through the `addPricePoints` function without any validation or checks on the price values being added. This means that a centralized authority or malicious actor could potentially add arbitrary price points, leading to price manipulation. If the price points are not derived from a reliable source or if they are manipulated, it could result in unfair trades and exploitation of users relying on this data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a validation mechanism that checks the authenticity and accuracy of the price data before allowing it to be added to the `pricePoints` array. This could involve integrating with a trusted oracle service or requiring that price points be submitted by a verified source.
'''

```

```
LACK OF DECENTRALIZED PRICE ORACLE
'''
The contract does not utilize a decentralized or transparent mechanism for determining token prices, which could allow a controlling entity to manipulate prices at will. The current implementation relies on the input provided by the user, which can be arbitrary and unverified. This lack of decentralization can lead to exploitation by the controlling entity, as they can submit inflated or deflated prices to benefit their trades.

To address this issue, it is advisable to integrate a decentralized price oracle that provides reliable and tamper-proof price data. This would ensure that the prices used in the contract are based on real market conditions and are less susceptible to manipulation by any single party.

```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Assumption of Fixed-Length Array. There are two cases where the contract may have Assumption of Fixed-Length Array vulnerabilities:
1. When the contract incorrectly assumes that an array returned by a function has a fixed length, potentially leading to data corruption or out-of-bounds errors if the actual array length differs.
2. When the contract does not handle dynamic array lengths properly, causing incorrect data processing or logic errors.
If you identify all Assumption of Fixed-Length Array vulnerabilities, respond with: """,,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified.

POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract `MirinOracleMock` does not enforce any checks on the timestamps being added in the `addPricePoints` function. This could lead to inconsistent data being stored in the `pricePoints` array. For example, if a user adds price points with timestamps that are not in chronological order, it could lead to confusion when retrieving price data later, as the assumption might be that the data is ordered by timestamp.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a check that ensures the timestamps are in ascending order before adding them to the `pricePoints` array. This can be done by comparing each timestamp with the previous one during the loop that adds the price points.

Example implementation:
```solidity
function addPricePoints(
    uint256[] memory _timestamps,
    uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
    uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
) public onlyOwner {
    require(_timestamps.length == _price0Cumulatives.length && _price0Cumulatives.length == _price1Cumulatives.length, ""price point arrays must have same length"");
    
    uint256 lastTimestamp = 0; // Initialize to zero or a suitable minimum value

POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCY
'''
The contract `MirinOracleMock` does not enforce any checks on the timestamps being added in the `addPricePoints` function. This could lead to inconsistent data being stored in the `pricePoints` array. For example, if a user adds price points with timestamps that are not in chronological order, it could lead to confusion when retrieving price data later, as the assumption might be that the data is ordered by timestamp.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a check that ensures the timestamps are in ascending order before adding them to the `pricePoints` array. This can be done by comparing each timestamp with the previous one during the loop that adds the price points.

Example implementation:
```solidity
function addPricePoints(
    uint256[] memory _timestamps,
    uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
    uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
) public onlyOwner {
    require(_timestamps.length == _price0Cumulatives.length && _price0Cumulatives.length == _price1Cumulatives.length, ""price point arrays must have same length"");
    
    uint256 lastTimestamp = 0; // Initialize to zero or a suitable minimum value
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _timestamps.length; i++) {
        require(_timestamps[i] > lastTimestamp, ""Timestamps must be in ascending order"");
        lastTimestamp = _timestamps[i]; // Update lastTimestamp to the current one
        pricePoints.push(PricePoint(
            _timestamps[i],
            _price0Cumulatives[i],
            _price1Cumulatives[i]
        ));
    }
}

```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Hash Collision. This type of vulnerability occurs when different inputs produce the same hash due to improper handling of concatenated values, leading to potential security issues.
Proceed with the following steps in your analysis:
1. Scrutinize the contract's code to identify any functions that generate hashes from input values.
2. Look for patterns where multiple input values are concatenated without clear delimiters before hashing. Pay special attention to the use of `abi.encodePacked` for concatenation.
3. Determine if the concatenated inputs can produce the same hash for different combinations of input values, leading to potential hash collisions.
4. Evaluate the logic for generating and handling hashes within the contract to ensure that the potential for hash collisions is minimized.
If you discover any Hash Collision vulnerabilities, respond with: """,,,,"<INFO> Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier Identified.

VULNERABILITY NAME: Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier
'''
The `addPricePoints` function in the `MirinOracleMock` contract is publicly accessible, meaning that any user can call this function and add price points to the `pricePoints` array. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the price data, which is critical for the integrity of the oracle's functionality. An attacker could potentially manipulate the price points, leading to incorrect pricing information being used by other contracts that rely on this oracle.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier, to restrict access to the `addPricePoints` function. This would ensure that only the contract owner can add price points, thereby maintaining the integrity of the data.

Example of implementation:
```solidity
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"";

contract MirinOracleMock is IMirinOracle, Ownable {
    ...
    function addPricePoints(
        uint256[] memory _timestamps,
        uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
        uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
    ) public onlyOwner {

VULNERABILITY NAME: Missing 'onlyOwner' Modifier
'''
The `addPricePoints` function in the `MirinOracleMock` contract is publicly accessible, meaning that any user can call this function and add price points to the `pricePoints` array. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the price data, which is critical for the integrity of the oracle's functionality. An attacker could potentially manipulate the price points, leading to incorrect pricing information being used by other contracts that rely on this oracle.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism, such as the `onlyOwner` modifier, to restrict access to the `addPricePoints` function. This would ensure that only the contract owner can add price points, thereby maintaining the integrity of the data.

Example of implementation:
```solidity
import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"";

contract MirinOracleMock is IMirinOracle, Ownable {
    ...
    function addPricePoints(
        uint256[] memory _timestamps,
        uint256[] memory _price0Cumulatives,
        uint256[] memory _price1Cumulatives
    ) public onlyOwner {
        ...
    }
}
'''
"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Misuse of `msg.value` within a Loop. There are key indicators of this vulnerability:
1. Incorrectly allocating the total `msg.value` to each item within a loop, rather than dividing `msg.value` properly among the items.
2. Misallocation of funds where each iteration of the loop assigns the entire `msg.value` instead of the correct portion, leading to an unintended and excessive distribution.
If you identify Misuse of `msg.value` within a Loop, respond with: """,,,,"<INFO> External Oracle Dependency Identified.

**VULNERABILITY: Dependence on a Single External Oracle**
'''
The contract relies on an external oracle for price data, which can lead to significant risks if the oracle is compromised or provides incorrect data. If the oracle fails or is manipulated, the integrity of the price points stored in the contract could be jeopardized, leading to potential financial losses or exploitation. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement a multi-oracle approach where data is aggregated from multiple oracles to enhance reliability. Additionally, incorporating a mechanism to validate the data received from the oracle before it is used in critical functions can further safeguard against erroneous data.
'''

**VULNERABILITY: Lack of Fallback Mechanisms**
'''
The contract does not include any fallback mechanisms to handle scenarios where the oracle call fails or returns invalid data. This absence can lead to contract failure, rendering it unusable in critical situations. To address this issue, it is advisable to implement error handling and fallback functions that can gracefully manage failures. For instance, the contract could revert transactions if the oracle data is not valid or provide a default value to ensure that the contract remains operational even in the event of an oracle failure.

LACK OF ACCESS CONTROL
'''
The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms, which means that any user can call the `addPricePoints` function. This could lead to a situation where a malicious actor could add arbitrary price points, potentially manipulating the data stored in the contract. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism, such as using OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl contracts, to restrict the execution of critical functions like `addPricePoints` to authorized addresses only.
'''
```"".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to perform a thorough and detailed inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Funding Rate Calculation Precision. There are two cases where the code may have Funding Rate Calculation Precision vulnerabilities:
1. Simplistic funding rate calculation that does not consider all necessary factors. This can lead to incorrect funding rates, which can be manipulated by providing incorrect input values. A robust funding rate calculation should account for various factors and validations to prevent exploitation.
2. Lack of input validation for critical parameters (e.g., spotPrice, markPrice) used in the funding rate calculation. Malicious actors could potentially manipulate these parameters to influence the funding rate calculation.
If you identify a Simplistic funding rate calculation or Lack of input validation, respond with: """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Input Validation Identified.

```
LACK OF INPUT VALIDATION IN addPricePoints FUNCTION
'''
The addPricePoints function does not validate the values of the timestamps, price0Cumulatives, and price1Cumulatives being added to the pricePoints array. This can lead to several issues:
1. Timestamps could be in the past or future, which may not be appropriate for the intended use of the price points.
2. Price values could be negative or excessively large, which may cause overflow issues or logical errors in future calculations.

Recommended Mitigation:
- Validate that timestamps are not in the past (i.e., they should be greater than or equal to the current block timestamp).
- Ensure that price0Cumulatives and price1Cumulatives are non-negative and within a reasonable range.
- Implement checks to prevent duplicate timestamps if that is a requirement for the logic of the contract.

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: ""Identify all potential DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities in the provided Solidity smart contract."".
Ideas: ""DoS vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms in Solidity contracts, such as Gas Limit DoS, External Call DoS, Block Gas Limit DoS, and State Dependency DoS."".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS). DoS vulnerabilities can occur in the following cases:
1. When loops have an unbounded iteration count, leading to potential gas exhaustion.
2. When the contract makes external calls that can fail or consume excessive gas.
3. When the contract depends on certain state conditions that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause failures.
4. When an attacker can send high-gas transactions to consume most of the block's gas limit, making it difficult for other transactions to be included in the block.
Please conduct a thorough analysis, considering the following information:
1. Review the contract's code logic to identify any potential areas where unbounded loops might cause gas exhaustion.
2. Examine external calls in the contract and ensure they are handled properly to avoid excessive gas consumption or failures.
3. Analyze state-dependent logic to identify any potential manipulations that could cause DoS.
4. Consider the overall design of the contract to ensure it is resilient against high-gas transactions and other DoS tactics.
If you identify any DoS vulnerabilities, respond with: ""","<INFO> DoS Vulnerability Identified.

**UNBOUNDED LOOP VULNERABILITY**
'''
The `addPricePoints` function contains a loop that iterates over the length of the input arrays. If an attacker provides excessively large arrays as input, this could lead to gas exhaustion, causing the transaction to fail. Since there is no upper limit enforced on the size of the arrays, this presents a risk of Denial of Service (DoS) by making the contract unable to process legitimate transactions.

**Mitigation Measures:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can implement a maximum limit on the number of price points that can be added in a single transaction. For example, you could add a require statement at the beginning of the `addPricePoints` function to check that the length of the input arrays does not exceed a predefined constant, such as 100 or 200.
'''

**EXTERNAL CALL VULNERABILITY**
'''
While the current implementation does not make any external calls, if future modifications introduce external calls (e.g., to other contracts or oracles), there is a risk that these calls could fail or consume excessive gas. If an external call fails, it could lead to a situation where the contract is unable to perform its intended functions, resulting in a DoS condition.

**Mitigation Measures:**
To prevent this, ensure that any future external calls are handled with proper error handling, such as using `try/catch` for external contract calls or checking return values. Additionally, consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to minimize risks associated with external calls.
