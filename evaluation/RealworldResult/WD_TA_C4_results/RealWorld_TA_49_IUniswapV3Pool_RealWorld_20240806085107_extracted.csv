,,,,,,,,,,,,"<INFO> Lack of Withdrawal Function Identified. 

The provided contract code does not include any functions that allow users to withdraw their deposited funds. This absence poses a significant risk to users, as they have no means to retrieve their assets once deposited into the contract. 

### Impact on Users:
1. **User Funds at Risk**: Without a withdrawal function, users may lose access to their funds indefinitely, leading to a lack of trust in the contract.
2. **Potential for Abuse**: If the contract is designed to hold user funds without a means to withdraw, it could be exploited by malicious actors who may find ways to lock or drain funds.
3. **Regulatory Concerns**: Contracts that do not allow for withdrawals may face scrutiny from regulatory bodies, as they could be seen as custodial without proper safeguards.

### Importance of a Secure Withdrawal Mechanism:
A secure withdrawal mechanism is essential for any contract that holds user funds. It ensures that users can access their assets when needed and protects against potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks. Implementing a withdrawal function that adheres to best practices, such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, is crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of the contract. 

### Recommended Action:
To mitigate the identified risk, it is imperative to implement a secure withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their funds safely. This function should include:
- Proper access control to ensure only the rightful owner can withdraw their funds.
- Implementation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Clear documentation and user guidance on how to use the withdrawal function securely.
