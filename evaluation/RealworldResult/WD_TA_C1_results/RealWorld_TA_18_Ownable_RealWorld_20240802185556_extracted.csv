CENTRALIZATION RISK - Single Owner Control
'''
The contract has a single owner model, where all critical functions (such as transferring ownership and renouncing ownership) can only be executed by the owner. This centralization creates a risk where if the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could take control of the contract and perform malicious actions. Additionally, the owner can renounce ownership, which would leave the contract without an owner, potentially locking users out of critical functions.

Recommended Mitigation:
Implement a multi-signature wallet for ownership functions, requiring multiple parties to approve critical actions. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure and enhances security. Alternatively, consider implementing a time-lock mechanism for sensitive operations, allowing users to react before changes take effect.
