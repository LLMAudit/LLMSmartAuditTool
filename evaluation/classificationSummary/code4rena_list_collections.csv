#### 5 **Arithmetic and Precision Issues**

* Use of fixed-point math (WAD/RAY) with truncation causing value leakage
* Rounding issues in auction settlement logic could lead to unfair allocations
* Inadequate floor/ceiling rounding in interest rate applications

#### 6 **Input Validation and Sanity Checks**

* Missing validation for curve parameters (`a`, `b`, `tau`) in rate setting
* Absence of input bounds in `mint`, `redeem`, or auction-related functions
* No sanity checks for time-based values (e.g., negative time-to-maturity)

#### 7 **Standards Compliance and Compatibility Issues**

* ERC4626 deviations (e.g., `previewRedeem()` may revert under edge cases)
* No compatibility handling for non-standard ERC20s (e.g., rebasing or fee-on-transfer tokens)
* Lack of event emissions in critical lifecycle functions (e.g., auction bids, ZCB redemptions)

#### 8 **DoS and System Integrity Risks**

* Auctions can be permanently stalled if no valid bids are submitted
* ZCB redemptions may revert due to liquidity shortfall if interest curve was misused
* Maturity mismatches can lead to debt not being covered on time, risking fund insolvency

#### 9 **Gas Inefficiencies and Optimization Opportunities**

* Repeated calls to interest curve evaluators without caching
* Inefficient loop constructs in `settleAuction` and `assignBids`
* Use of nested conditionals and state writes that could be batched for gas savings

#### 10 **Best Practices and Code Hygiene**

* Missing NatSpec and poorly documented custom math libraries (e.g., `YieldCurveMath`)
* Magic numbers (e.g., `1e18`, `3600`) scattered without constants
* Complex logic in `TermAuction` and `ZCBPool` reducing modular clarity
* Misleading or vague `require` messages throughout system contracts"
192,"### Vulnerability Categorization by Nature

#### 1 **Authorization and Access Control Flaws**

* `Governance` roles allowed to set sensitive parameters (e.g., swap fees, oracles) without sufficient safety checks
* Misuse of `gov` or `admin` roles risks mispricing, unauthorized liquidity adjustments, or systemic parameter abuse
* Lack of time-delay mechanisms for risky updates (e.g., `setFeeParams()`)

#### 2 **Economic and Business Logic Flaws**

* Faulty logic in AMM curve computation (e.g., misconfigured constants in `GyroECLPMath`) can cause pool imbalance or incorrect swap pricing
* Errors in fee accumulation or distribution logic may cause economic unfairness among LPs or traders
* Inaccurate assumptions in `mint()` and `burn()` calculations leading to liquidity mismanagement

#### 3 **Oracle and External Data Risks**

* Overdependence on external pricing feeds without freshness or deviation checks
* Risk of stale data leading to invalid mint/burn decisions or mispriced swaps
* No robust fallback mechanism if oracles fail or are manipulated

#### 4 **Reentrancy, Front-Running, and Griefing Risks**

* Absence of reentrancy protection on core pool operations (e.g., `swap`, `mint`, `burn`)
* Potential for griefing through arbitrage exploitation in poorly parameterized curves
* Front-running of oracle updates or swap fee adjustments impacting pool participants

#### 5 **Arithmetic and Precision Issues**

* Use of complex math (e.g., exponential/logarithmic calculations) vulnerable to precision loss
* Rounding errors in swap fee or invariant computation can accumulate over time
* Incorrect casting or underflow in `Math.sol` utility operations

#### 6 **Input Validation and Sanity Checks**

* Inadequate validation of fee configuration inputs (e.g., negative or overly high fees)
* Lack of checks for pool creation parameters like amplification factors and token weights
* Missing guards against zero address or duplicate token inputs in pool instantiation

#### 7 **Standards Compliance and Compatibility Issues**

* Non-standard token handling assumptions may break for rebasing, fee-on-transfer, or non-ERC20-conformant tokens
* Insufficient ERC4626 behavior compliance for vault-related logic
* Missing `indexed` fields in key events reducing traceability

#### 8 **DoS and System Integrity Risks**

* Curve misconfiguration can cause pool to lock funds or reject swaps entirely
* Oracle failure or parameter misupdate can halt minting or burning of pool tokens
* Imbalanced pool state due to initialization or corner-case trades may lead to permanent malfunction

#### 9 **Gas Inefficiencies and Optimization Opportunities**

* Recalculation of invariant and fee logic on each call without caching or optimization
* Nested external calls and loops during `burn()` or `mint()` operations increase gas cost
* Unnecessary use of storage variables in local-scope logic

#### 10 **Best Practices and Code Hygiene**

* Missing NatSpec and incomplete inline documentation
* Vague error messages in `require()` statements
* Complex math expressions without modular breakdown
* Use of hardcoded constants (e.g., `1e18`, `3600`) instead of named symbolic constants"
