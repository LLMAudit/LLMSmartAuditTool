**VULNERABILITY NAME: Lack of Input Validation in Role Management Functions**
'''
The contract allows for the granting and revocation of roles without validating the input parameters, specifically the `role` and `account` parameters in functions such as `grantRole`, `revokeRole`, `grantRoles`, and `revokeRoles`. This can lead to several issues:
1. **Zero Address**: If a zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) is passed as the `account`, it would allow the zero address to be granted roles, which is typically not desirable in access control scenarios.
2. **Invalid Role**: If an invalid role (not previously defined) is passed, it could lead to unexpected behavior since the contract does not check if the role exists before granting or revoking it.

**Recommended Mitigation/Fix**:
- Implement checks to ensure that the `account` is not a zero address before granting or revoking roles.
- Validate that the `role` exists in the `_roles` mapping before performing any operations on it. This can be done by checking if the `adminRole` of the role is not equal to the default value (e.g., LOCK).
